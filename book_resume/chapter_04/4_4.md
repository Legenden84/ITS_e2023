# 4.4 Key authentication properties and goals

## Overview

The text discusses the critical properties and goals associated with Key Establishment Protocols. It outlines the attributes of a 'good key' and describes advanced properties such as Forward Secrecy, Known-Key Security, and various forms of Authentication. The text also touches upon the Station-to-Station (STS) Authentication Properties and Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) Logic.

## Protocol Goals and Properties

### Good Key Requirements

- **Freshness**: A good key should be a new value and not reused from a previous session.
- **Sufficient Length**: The key must be long enough to provide adequate security.
- **Randomness**: The key should be generated randomly.
- **Known Parties**: Parties involved should know with whom the key is shared.

## Forward Secrecy

- **Definition**: A protocol provides forward secrecy if the disclosure of long-term keys does not compromise the secrecy of session keys from earlier runs.
- **Conditions for Forward Secrecy**:
  1. Old session keys can't be reconstructed from long-term keys.
  2. Session keying material should be ephemeral, vanishing at the end of the session.
- **Example**: Diffie-Hellman protocol provides this property if secrets (a, b) are fresh and securely deleted after the session.

## Known-Key Security

- **Definition**: A key establishment protocol should ensure that compromised session keys do not jeopardize future key management.
- **Impact**: Compromised session keys should not allow later impersonation or compromise of future session keys.

## Entity Authentication, Liveness, Key-Use Confirmation

- **Entity Authentication**: Should be done jointly with key establishment in real-time communication.
- **Liveness**: Indicates that the far-end party is actively participating at the current moment.
- **Key-Use Confirmation**: One party having explicit evidence that another party possesses the correct session or data key.

## Implicit and Explicit Authentication

- **Implicit Authentication**: The scope of who possibly has key access is narrowed to a specifically identified party, but possession is not confirmed.
  - **Example**: RSA encryption for key transfer.
- **Explicit Authentication**: Obtained by combining Implicit Authentication with Key-Use Confirmation.

## STS Authentication Properties

- **Key-Use Confirmation**: Verification success after decryption provides this to party A.
- **Entity Authentication**: Assured by B's signature over a fresh value.
- **Implicit Key Authentication**: Delivered by Bâ€™s signature on the exponentials.
- **Explicit Key Authentication**: Obtained by combining Key-Use Confirmation with Implicit Key Authentication.

## Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) Logic

- **BAN Logic**: A systematic method for studying authentication and authenticated key establishment protocols.
- **BAN Logic Proof**: The text hints at summarizing the main steps involved in a BAN logic proof.
- **BAN Analysis of X.509**: Suggested for further study.
- **Beliefs in Key Establishment**: Discusses the variety of beliefs parties may have about keys during the protocol.

## Exercises

- The text also includes exercises on BAN logic and suggests looking into:
  - Main steps involved in a BAN logic proof.
  - BAN analysis of the X.509 authentication protocol.
  - Ideas to add reasoning about public-key agreement to BAN.
  - Variety of beliefs that parties in authenticated key establishment may have about keys.
