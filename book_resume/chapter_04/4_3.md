# 4.3 Establishing shared keys by public agreement (DH)

## Introduction
The text discusses the mechanisms for establishing shared cryptographic keys between two parties through public agreement. The methods covered include Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (DH), ElGamal encryption, and the Station-to-Station protocol (STS), which provides mutual authentication for DH. Additionally, mathematical backgrounds relevant to these methods are referenced in Section 4.8.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (DH)
### Overview
Diffie-Hellman (DH) was invented in 1976 and allows two parties to establish a shared secret without prior contact or pre-shared keys. The process uses a public channel for the exchange of numbers.

### Parameters
- **Prime Number (p)**: A large prime number.
- **Generator (g)**: A generator for the multiplicative group of integers modulo `p`.

### Protocol Steps
1. Party A sends \( g^a \mod p \) to Party B.
2. Party B computes \( K = (g^a)^b \mod p \).
3. Party B sends \( g^b \mod p \) to Party A.
4. Party A computes \( K = (g^b)^a \mod p \).

### Security
- Security relies on the difficulty of the "discrete logarithm problem."
- Private keys `a` and `b` are chosen randomly from [1, p-2].
- An eavesdropper cannot calculate \( g^{ab} \) as they do not have access to `a` or `b`.

### Post-Processing
- The DH key \( K \) is further processed by a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to create the actual session key.

## ElGamal Encryption
### Overview
ElGamal is a variation of DH used for key transport.

### Protocol Steps
- The recipient computes \( g^a \mod p \) and publicizes it as a public key.
- Sender B encrypts a message \( m \) by sending \( c = (y, d) \), where \( y = g^k \mod p \) and \( d = m \cdot (g^a)^k \mod p \).
- The recipient can decrypt to recover \( m \).

## Vulnerabilities and Attacks
### Small-Subgroup Attacks
- An attacker could exploit small subgroups to weaken the key.
- Additional protocol checks are necessary to prevent this.

### Middle-Person (MITM) Attacks
- A MITM attack can intercept and alter messages.
- Basic DH is vulnerable as it is unauthenticated.

## STS Protocol
### Overview
STS turns unauthenticated DH into authenticated DH using digital signatures.

### Protocol Steps
1. A sends \( g^a \) to B.
2. B sends \( g^b \) and a digital signature encrypted under \( K \) to A.
3. A sends its digital signature encrypted under \( K \) to B.

## Conclusion
The text covers various cryptographic methods for establishing shared keys, potential vulnerabilities, and ways to safeguard against them. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding these protocols to ensure secure authentication and key establishment.
