# 7.2 Viruses and Worms

## Overview
This section delves into the concept of computer viruses and worms, their characteristics, and how they operate. It also distinguishes between the two and discusses various related topics like email-based malware and virus detection methods.

## Definition: Virus
- **Definition**: A computer virus is a program that infects other programs by modifying them to include a copy of itself.
- **Propagation**: Spreads to further programs or files on the same machine and across machines through human action like inserting a USB drive or clicking on an email attachment.
- **Embedding**: A virus inserts itself into a host program or file and makes sure its own code runs when the host is executed.

### Generic Structure of a Virus
Outlined are four stages that a typical virus goes through:
1. **Dormancy**: Awaiting host program execution.
2. **Propagation**: The mechanism by which the virus spreads.
3. **Trigger Condition**: Determines when the harmful payload will be executed.
4. **Payload**: Actual malicious action, ranging from benign to severe.

## How Worms Differ
Worms differ from viruses in three main ways:
1. Propagate automatically and continuously, without user intervention.
2. Spread over networks using network protocols and daemons.
3. Exploit software vulnerabilities, e.g., buffer overflows.

### Additional Points
- Worms, due to their autonomous spreading, can overload networks and can even cause a denial of service (DoS).

---

## Email-Based Malware
- Termed as email virus, email worm, or mass-mailing worm-virus.
- Spreads through email file infections, attachments, and default client features.
- Requires user action and may involve social engineering.

---

## Malware and Privileges
- Malware isn't magical; it is just software but can do extraordinarily complex things, especially if it has elevated privileges.

---

## Program File Viruses
- Most viruses infect executable files.
- Various strategies for infection are discussed, such as "Shift and Prepend," "Append," "Overwrite from top," and "Overwrite from an interior point."

---

## Viruses: Alternate Definition
- An alternative definition by Szor is presented that considers virus-like programs that don't need to embed themselves in other programs.

---

## Historical Examples
- **Brain Virus (1986)**: A boot sector virus, initially spread through floppy disks.
- **CIH Chernobyl Virus (1998-2000)**: Extremely destructive, affecting both hardware and software.

---

## Data File Viruses and Related Malware
- Issues arising from data documents like PDFs or Word documents which can contain embedded scripts and can thus be vectors for viruses.

---

## Virus Detection: Undecidable Problem
- Argues that it's theoretically impossible for a program to correctly detect all viruses. This section contains a proof to support the claim.

---

## Virus Detection in Practice
- Discusses practical methods of virus detection, like the use of "denylists" and "allowlists," pattern-matching algorithms, and the issues related to "zero-days."
