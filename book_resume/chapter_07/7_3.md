# 7.3 Virus Anti-Detection and Worm-Spreading Techniques

## Introduction
This section comprehensively discusses strategies employed by viruses to evade detection and elaborates on various methods utilized by network worms to propagate swiftly.

## Anti-Detection Strategies for Viruses

### 1. Virus with Encrypted Body
- **Description**: These viruses encrypt their core body with a fixed string or symmetric-key encryption. Execution requires decrypting the virus first.
- **Detection**: The decryption key is stored within an unchanging small decryptor portion, making these viruses susceptible to string-matching virus detectors.
- **Key Variation**: To make detection more challenging, the decryption key can change with each new infection.

### 2. Polymorphic Virus
- **Description**: These viruses not only encrypt their bodies with per-instance keys but also change their decryptor portions using a mutation engine.
- **Weak vs. Strong Forms**:
    - Weak form stores a pool of decryptors and chooses one for each infection.
    - Strong forms use a mini-compiler to create numerous decryptor variations.
- **Detection**: The viruses still revert to a static body after decryption, making them detectable via emulated pre-run checks.

### 3. Virus with External Decryption Key
- **Description**: The decryption key is stored outside the virus, complicating manual analysis.
- **Storage Locations**: The key could be in another file on the same host, an external machine, or generated from host-specific data.
- **Advanced Techniques**: The key could be retrieved via a search engine query or domain name lookup that is frequently updated.

### 4. Metamorphic Virus
- **Description**: These viruses mutate their entire codebase, including their mutation engine, with each infection.
- **No Encryption**: They do not use encryption and hence have no decryptor portion.
- **Code Mutation**: The virus could even carry its source code and use host machine compilers to help in mutation.

### Other Tactics to Hide Infection Signs
- **Description**: Tactics to hide attributes like filesystem changes, code location, and resource consumption.
- **Note**: Further elaborated in Section 7.4 in association with rootkits.

## Importance of Reverse Engineering as a Skill
- **Necessity**: Given the complexity and obfuscation techniques employed by malware, reverse engineering is crucial in the anti-malware industry.
- **Skillset**: Extensive knowledge of machine language, debuggers, disassemblers, decompilers, and emulation tools are needed.

## Auto-Rooters
- **Description**: Auto-rooters are malicious programs that scan for vulnerable targets and exploit them to gain root access.
- **User Interface**: They have fully automated UIs and require no technical skills.
- **Defenses**: Include disabling unused services, software updates, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

## Localized and Context-Aware Scanning in Worms
- **Targeting Strategy**: Worms target based on probabilities of vulnerability and closeness in network topology.
- **Code Red II Example**: Explains the probabilities used by Code Red II worm to choose its next target.
- **Information Harvesting**: Worms may use email lists, peer-to-peer lists, URLs, and bookmarks to find populated addresses.

## Faster Worm Spreading Techniques
- **Hit-List Scanning**: To speed up the initial spread, a list of vulnerable hosts is created and divided among the first few infected targets.
- **Permutation Scanning**: To avoid re-contacting already infected machines, a fixed ordering of addresses is used.
- **Internet-Scale Hit-Lists**: Lists containing millions of potential targets are pre-generated for accelerated propagation.
- **Flash Worms**: Itâ€™s estimated that using these techniques, a flash worm could infect all vulnerable hosts in tens of seconds.

## Case Study: The 1988 Internet Worm
- **Impact**: Infected 10% of Internet devices then in use and caused denial of service.
- **Exploitation Methods**: Enumerates the four software vulnerabilities exploited by the worm.
- **Consequences**: This early event foreshadowed a wave of malicious worms in the early 2000s.

## Exercise: Morris Worm Details
- **Task**: The exercise calls for an explanation of the technical details behind the Morris Worm exploits and the lessons learned from it.
- **Is This Progress?**: Compares the recovery procedure in 1988 to that after the 2016 Yahoo! compromise, questioning the progress made in security protocols.
