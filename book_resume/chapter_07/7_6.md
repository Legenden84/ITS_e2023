# 7.6 Drive-by downloads and droppers

The text is a technical and in-depth analysis of how malware exploits browser functionalities to compromise systems. It discusses two primary methods of exploitation: drive-by downloads and droppers. Here are the main sections:

## Malware Exploiting Browser Use

- This section explains the inherent risks in modern web browsing. It points out that web pages are written in HTML and may contain embedded content, including scripts like JavaScript.
- These scripts execute on the user's machine as part of the browser's function. The danger arises when these scripts contain malicious code.
- By exploiting browser vulnerabilities, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web page. When a user visits this compromised page, malware may be automatically downloaded and executed on the user's device.
- This unauthorized download and execution of binary files through a browser is termed as "drive-by download."

## Means of Drive-By Exploitation

- This segment provides a more granular look into how drive-by downloads operate.
- It asks three main questions: how do malicious scripts get embedded into web pages, how are malicious binaries downloaded, and why are these activities usually invisible to users.
- Various embedding sources are identified: ads on web pages, third-party widgets (like weather updates), user-generated content on forums, and malicious parameters in URLs received via email.
- The text also describes the method in which a browser is redirected to download binaries from a malicious site.
- Redirects often go unnoticed because they are common in legitimate browsing and easy to hide, such as through zero-pixel iframes.

## Deployment Means Vs. Malware Category

- This section discusses that drive-by downloads are not a separate category of malware but a method of delivering various types of malware like keyloggers, backdoors, and rootkits.
- One of the key distinctions here is that victim devices initiate the contact in a 'pull model' by visiting the compromised web site, unlike traditional worms that operate in a 'push model.'

## Droppers (Downloaders)

- A "dropper" is defined as a type of malware that serves to install other malware components. If it downloads additional malware pieces, it may also be called a "downloader."
- Droppers may also install backdoors to facilitate further installations and updates.
- These droppers can arrive through various means, including viruses, worms, drive-by downloads, or even user-installed Trojan horse software.

## Example: Babylonia Dropper

- The section concludes with an example of one of the first widespread malware programs with dropper functionality, known as the "Babylonia" virus from 1999.
- Although Babylonia itself wasn't malicious, it paved the way for future botnets by having the functionality to download additional executable files.

In summary, the text serves as an exhaustive guide to understanding the intricacies of drive-by downloads and droppers in the context of malware exploiting web browsers.
