# 7.8 Social engineering and categorizing malware

The text is divided into multiple subsections, focusing primarily on the tactics of social engineering and the different ways malware can be categorized.

## Social Engineering and User-Enabled Installs

1. **Introduction**: The section begins by contrasting social engineering attacks against malware that installs silently. It points out how social engineering tricks users into downloading, installing, and executing malware in a single step.

2. **Historical Example**: It cites the Happy99 worm from 1999 as an early instance where an email worm convinced users to run an attached executable.

3. **Role of OS Design**: The text points out that some operating systems' user-friendly interfaces hide file extensions, making it easier for such attacks to succeed. It explains that double-clicking a file can lead to automatic program execution based on OS settings, which it calls "user-enabled execution."

### Examples

1. **HTML Email and Preview Panes**:
   - The section discusses the evolution of email from text-only to HTML-embedded.
   - It highlights the risks of embedded scripting, such as JavaScript in email content.
   - The mistake, it mentions, was failing to foresee that this rich functionality could be exploited. It highlights how Microsoft Outlook used to run embedded JavaScript merely by previewing an email.
   - Finally, it discusses the current secure state where most email clients disable such functionality.

2. **.zip Files**:
   - The text focuses on extensions like `.zip`, `.rar`, and `.sfx`, which are compressed packages.
   - It talks about self-extracting executables that perform multiple operations like uncompressing, saving files to disk, and initiating execution on a double-click.
   - The section raises concern over how little users understand what a double-click on such a file can authorize.

3. **Exercises**:
   - The text includes exercises that challenge the reader to think deeply about the implications of social engineering and design flaws. These exercises address filename extensions, tactics for gaining user attention and deception, and how design principles like "simplicity and necessity" and "least privilege" relate to malware.

## Malware Classification by Objectives

1. **Damage to Host and Data**: Intentional destruction of data or disruption of the host machine.

2. **Data Theft**: Stealing of corporate files, intellectual property, and personal data. It may also involve theft of credentials like passwords.

3. **Direct Financial Gain**: Includes deception into purchasing unneeded products and extortion via ransomware.

4. **Ongoing Surveillance**: Covert recording of voice, video, and user activities.

5. **Spread of Malware**: Using compromised machines to further propagate the malware.

6. **Control of Resources**: Utilizing compromised machine's resources for various tasks like botnet service or bitcoin mining.

## Malware Classification by Technical Properties

1. **Self-replication**: Whether the malware breeds on its own.

2. **Requirement of a Host Program**: Whether the malware needs a host program to operate.

3. **Covert Nature**: Whether it takes measures to remain undetected.

4. **Infection Vector**: How the malware infects, either automatically or through user intervention.

5. **Insider Aid**: Whether the malware uses help from someone with internal access.

6. **Persistence**: Whether the malware is transient or remains active over time.

The text concludes with a mention that Table 7.2 summarizes these issues.
