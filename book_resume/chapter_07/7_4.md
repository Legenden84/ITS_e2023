# 7.4 Stealth: Trojan horses, backdoors, keyloggers, rootkits

## Introduction

The text dives into the subject of malware that employs stealth techniques to evade or delay detection. It is organized as a comprehensive review of several types of stealthy malware—specifically, Trojan horses, backdoors, keyloggers, and rootkits. The categorization of these types of malware is based on the goals and methods they use.

## Trojan Horses

### Origin
The section starts by referring to the legend of the Trojan horse in Troy as a metaphor for the software-based Trojan horses of today.

### Characteristics
Trojan horse software is described as delivering malicious functionality in addition to or instead of its advertised features. Some Trojan horses lure users into installing them by pretending to be critical updates for commonly used software like Java, Adobe Flash, or antivirus programs. Others are bundled with free applications like screen savers. They may even perform benign tasks (like playing music) while executing malicious activities in the background.

### Identification
The text clarifies that if malware is silently installed without the user's knowledge, it is generally not termed a Trojan horse. The term is reserved for software that the user “voluntarily” installs without being fully aware of its harmful functionalities.

## Backdoors

### Definition
A backdoor is described as a way to access a device that bypasses regular access control systems, usually for ongoing, stealthy, remote access.

### Types
Backdoors can be stand-alone programs or can be embedded into legitimate software. They are often included in Trojan software and rootkits.

## Rootkits

### Definition and Functions
Rootkits are defined as sets of software components that are secretly installed and actively work to hide their presence while controlling or manipulating host OS functions and applications. They facilitate additional malicious activities such as data theft, surveillance, and more.

### Types
The text distinguishes between user mode and kernel mode rootkits based on the level of system access they possess.

#### User Mode Rootkits
These operate in the user space of the system, often with superuser privileges. They are easier to detect and remove.

#### Kernel Mode Rootkits
These operate in the kernel space, thus having more access and power. They are more difficult to detect and remove.

## Rootkit Goals and Variants

### Payloads
Rootkits may carry various types of stealthy malware, including backdoors for ongoing remote access, software keyloggers for data theft, and surveillance tools for spying.

### Success Criteria
Success of a rootkit is contingent upon successful installation, remaining undetected, and effective payload functionality.

## Exercises
The text includes several exercises designed to deepen the reader's understanding:
- Distinguishing rootkits from Trojans.
- Technical details about a Linux kernel rootkit named 'lvtes' and Linux kernel backdoors.
- Information about Stuxnet 2010, a worm with rootkit functionality.
- Overview of the 2005 Sony rootkit controversy.
- Details on compiler trap doors.
- Explanation of memory isolation meltdown, its importance, and how it can be defeated.

The text indicates that these exercises have additional reading material as hints, suggesting that this is likely part of an educational curriculum or textbook on computer security.
