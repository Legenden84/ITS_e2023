# 5.8 Protection rings: isolation meets finer-grained sharing

## Overview

The text dives into the intricacies of protection rings as a middle-ground solution to achieve both secure isolation and shared convenience among processes and programs. Originating from Multics in the 1960s, protection rings offer varying degrees of privilege and control, mapping well with principles such as complete mediation, isolated compartments, and modular design.

## Key Concepts

### Protection Rings

- **Definition**: Protection rings are an advanced system for layered protection within processes.
- **Historical Context**: Introduced by Multics in the 1960s with hardware support for eight rings.
- **Functionality**: Allows for complete isolation, controlled sharing, and varying levels of privilege.

### Ring Numbers and Support

- **Rings 0 to n - 1**: These are considered as nested, ordered sets of levels.
- **Ring 0**: Most privileged, decreasing as you move outward.
- **Ring Number Field**: A new 'ring-num' field is added to every segment descriptor.
- **Access Bracket**: Defines a range of consecutive rings (n1, n2) that associates with each segment.

### Procedure Segment Access Brackets

- **In-bracket and Out-of-bracket Cases**: Distinguishes between two cases of ring transfer based on the access bracket of the target procedure segment.
- **Cross-ring Transfers**: Require additional checks to validate the access.

### Procedure Segment Gate Extension

- **Gate Extension**: To allow flexibility, a third parameter, n3, is added to the access bracket.
- **Gate List**: Pre-specified entry points for permitted ring transitions.

### Ring Gatekeeper Mediation

- **Mediation Process**: Ensures that the access rights are observed and appropriate checks are performed during a cross-ring transfer.

## Advanced Topics

### Execute, Read, Write Brackets

- **Brackets in Hardware Registers**: R1, R2, R3 might be used to define execute, read, and write access brackets.
- **RWX Access Rules**: Outlines the complete ruleset for read, write, and execute access to a segment.

### Reasoning for Choices

- **Lower Bounds**: Suggests that ring 0 processes should have access if any less privileged ring does.
- **Upper Bounds**: Argues for similarities between execute and read brackets.

### Alternate Bracket Ruleset

- **Different Interpretation**: Offers an alternative ruleset based on different interpretations of the hardware registers.

### Segment Descriptors From Access Control Entries

- **Creation of Descriptor Segment**: Describes how the descriptor segment is created for a new user process based on Access Control Lists (ACLs).

## Exercises

1. **Address Arguments Passed to Stronger Segment**: Discusses potential risks and the need for additional gatekeeper actions for inward calls.
2. **Ruleset Discussion**: Asks for a comparative analysis between the alternate bracket ruleset and other possible rulesets.
3. **Supervisor Creation of Descriptor Segment**: Questions the efficiency of different methods for creating a descriptor segment based on either capabilities or ACLs.

## Summary

The text offers a comprehensive look into the system of protection rings, discussing their historical background, various functionalities, advanced topics, and associated challenges and questions.
