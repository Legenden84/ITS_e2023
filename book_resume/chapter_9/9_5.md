# 9.5 Authentication cookies, malicious scripts and CSRF

### Introduction
The section discusses malicious scripts and HTML tags, focusing primarily on the security risks associated with authentication cookies and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. It briefly mentions that the subsequent sections (9.6â€“9.7) will cover cross-site scripting and SQL injection.

### Sub-section: Session IDs and Cookie Theft
- **Session IDs**: For facilitating browser sessions, servers store a randomly chosen number known as the 'session ID' in an HTTP cookie.
- **Authentication Cookies**: These cookies can also act as authentication tokens. After a user logs in, they usually don't need to re-authenticate for every subsequent page on the same site.
- **Session Expiry**: The server may specify a session expiration time that could be shorter than the cookie's lifetime.
- **Persistent Cookies**: If cookies are persistent, the authenticated session can last beyond the current browsing window and extend to future visits.

#### Risks
- **Target for Attackers**: These cookies can be attractive to attackers as they can give access to sensitive resources like a stored credit card number.
- **Session Hijacking**: Stealing these cookies can lead to HTTP session hijacking.

### Sub-section: Cookie Theft: Client-Side Security Risks

#### Ways to Steal Cookies
1. **Malicious JavaScript**: Injected in HTML documents and sending cookies to a malicious site.
2. **Untrustworthy Proxies and Middleboxes**: Especially when cookies are sent over HTTP.
3. **Non-Script Malware**: Defeats most client-side defenses.
4. **Unauthorized Physical Access**: To the device where cookies are stored.

### Sub-section: Cookie Protection: Server-Provided Integrity, Confidentiality
- **Integrity Risks**: A cookie is just a text string that can be modified.
- **Server-side Solutions**: Encryption and MAC (Message Authentication Codes) should be used for cookies holding sensitive values.
- **Replay Attacks**: Need to be addressed separately.

### Exercise: Cookie Security
- Asks the reader to summarize known security pitfalls of HTTP cookie implementations.

### Sub-section: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **How CSRF Works**: Discusses how if a user is logged into a site, an attacker can exploit this to make unauthorized transactions from the user's account.

#### Example: CSRF Attacks
- **Bank Transactions**: Describes a scenario involving a bank and how funds can be transferred by exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities.
- **Social Engineering**: Minor social engineering could be involved to trick the user into initiating the CSRF attack.

### Sub-section: CSRF: Further Notes
1. **Attack Results**: The response will go to the victim, not the attacker.
2. **IP Checks**: Cannot be used for CSRF defenses.
3. **Persistent Cookies**: Financial sites usually avoid them to reduce the risk.
4. **Confused Deputy Problem**: CSRF attacks are an example of this problem.
5. **Script Injection**: May or may not be involved in CSRF attacks.

### Sub-section: CSRF Mitigation
- **Secret Validation Tokens**: Recommends using secret tokens to validate the session and thereby mitigate CSRF attacks.

### Exercise: Mitigating CSRF
- Prompts to describe implementation details for CSRF validation tokens and their disadvantages. Also asks to describe an HMAC variant and its motivation.
