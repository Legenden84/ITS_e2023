# 9.6 More malicious scripts: cross-site scripting (XSS)

# Detailed Content Description of Text on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

The given text discusses cross-site scripting (XSS), which is a kind of web security vulnerability that involves the injection of malicious HTML tags or scripts into web pages. The text is divided into multiple subsections, each elaborating on different aspects of XSS, from its types to prevention mechanisms.

## Introduction to XSS
The text starts by defining XSS as an attack where malicious HTML tags or scripts are inserted into web pages, causing unintended actions when the page is rendered by a browser. It states that neither the legitimate websites nor the users intend these actions. The classical example provided involves stealing a user's cookies and sending them to an attacker-controlled site.

## Stored XSS Example
An example of Stored XSS is presented, showing how a user can post a malicious comment with both an image and a script in a web forum. The embedded script modifies the `src` attribute of the image tag to fetch the image from an attacker's site, along with sending the user's cookies as URL parameters.

## Sanitizing Input
The text emphasizes the importance of sanitizing user input to prevent XSS. It mentions methods like removing `<script>` tags or validating the input to ensure it doesn't execute as active content.

## Types of XSS
Three types of XSS are discussed:

1. Stored (Persistent) XSS
2. Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS
3. DOM-Based XSS

The text goes into detail about each type, especially Stored and Reflected XSS, and provides examples to illustrate the mechanisms behind these attacks.

## Reflected XSS Example
An example of a Reflected XSS attack is given, involving a file-not-found error page. The example demonstrates how an attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code within a hyperlink, which gets executed when a user clicks on it, leading to cookie theft and browser redirection.

## Further Comments and Examples
The text talks about the versatility of maliciously inserted JavaScript, explaining that it can execute in various contextsâ€”during page load, upon clicking links, or other browser-detected events. A second example of Reflected XSS is also provided, which uses URL parameters to execute malicious scripts.

## Potential Impacts of XSS
The text then lists the possible consequences of a successful XSS attack, which include:

1. Browser redirection
2. Access to authentication cookies and session tokens
3. Access to browser-stored data for the current site
4. Ability to rewrite the client's document, among other things

## Input Sanitization and Evasive Encoding
The section describes server-side filtering methods that can prevent simple XSS attacks. However, it also mentions how attackers can evade these filters using tactics like alternative character encodings. The text discusses output escaping and canonicalization as methods to counter such evasive techniques.

## Exercise on Mitigating XSS
An exercise is presented that prompts the reader to discuss the design and effectiveness of the Content Security Policy (CSP) in addressing XSS and CSRF attacks.

## Character Sets, Unicode, and Encoding
The text briefly dives into the complexities of character encoding, discussing ASCII, Unicode, and various UTF formats. It mentions how character encoding is declared in HTML, HTTP, and email headers and how browsers may use heuristics to guess the encoding scheme.

## HTML Special and URI Reserved Characters
Finally, the text discusses the HTML special characters and URI reserved characters. It explains the concept of escape sequences and percent encoding, providing the rationale behind why input filtering is challenging.

In summary, the text serves as an exhaustive guide to understanding, identifying, and mitigating XSS attacks, including insights into the technicalities of character encoding and input sanitization.
