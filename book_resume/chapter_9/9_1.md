# 9.1 Web review: domains, URLs, HTML, HTTP, scripts

### Web Concepts Introduction
The text begins by providing an overview of essential web concepts such as the Domain Name System (DNS), Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), domains, subdomains, and URL syntax.

#### Domain Name System (DNS)
- Defines a hierarchical scheme of domain names.
- Operational infrastructure supports this scheme.

#### Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)
- Specifies source locations of files and web pages.
- Displayed in the address bar of web browsers.

### Domains and Subdomains
- A domain name consists of one or more dot-separated parts, except for the DNS root denoted by a single dot.
- Top-level domains (TLDs) include generic TLDs (gTLDs) like `.com`, `.org` and country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) like `.uk`, `.fr`.
- Lower-level domains are subordinate to their parent domains.
- Second-level and third-level domains often represent organizations (e.g., `stanford.edu`) and departments (e.g., `cs.stanford.edu`).

### URL Syntax
- A URL is a type of uniform resource identifier (URI).
- URLs can be unqualified (host-specific) or fully qualified (globally unique).
- Hostname refers to an addressable machine with an IP address.

### Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
- A system for annotating text-based documents like web pages.
- Uses markup tags (e.g., `<p>` and `</p>`) to identify structures like paragraphs and headings.
- Supports hyperlinks and anchor tags to link to remote web pages.

### Executable Content in HTML
- HTML can contain active content like JavaScript.
- Scripts can be inline or externally linked.
- Scripts can be conditionally invoked based on browser events (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`).

### Document Loading, Parsing, JavaScript Execution
- Describes the process of script execution during browser loading and parsing.
- Scripts execute in order of appearance.
- `document.write()` can dynamically inject text into HTML.
- Scripts associated with event handlers execute when the event is detected.

### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- A protocol for data transfer between web browsers and servers.
- Defines request methods like GET, POST, and CONNECT.

### Web Forms
- Allows HTML documents to solicit user input.
- Uses `POST` or `GET` methods to send data to the specified URL.

### Referer Header
- Contains the URL of the page from which the request was made.
- Privacy concerns exist around leaking URL query parameters.

### HTTP Proxies
- Act as intermediaries between the client and the server.
- Have multiple purposes including access control, caching, and logging.

### HTTP CONNECT Method
- Facilitates setting up TCP connections for encrypted data transfer.
- Allows end-to-end virtual connections to tunnel through firewalls.

### (Ab)Use of HTTP Proxies
- Explains concerns around untrustworthy proxy servers and middle-person attacks.

### Browser (URL) Redirection
- Discusses various mechanisms to redirect browsers to other sites.
- JavaScript, meta tags, HTTP response headers can initiate redirection.
