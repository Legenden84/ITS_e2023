# 9.3 HTTP cookies and DOM objects

### Introduction and DOM

- **DOM Overview**: The section begins by discussing how HTML documents are internally represented in the browser. HTML documents are rendered as a document object, whose properties are also objects arranged in a hierarchical structure.
- **Browser Window and Frame**: A browser window or a partition of a window, termed as a frame, represents the HTML document. These are also managed by window objects in the browser's architecture.
- **Accessing HTML Content**: The content elements of an HTML document are accessed using `window.document`. The `document` object is a property of the `window` it resides in.
- **URL Components**: The `window.location` property houses the components of the URL of the associated document.
- **Document Object Model (DOM)**: The data structure rooted at `document` is standardized by DOM, and it serves as an API for JavaScript to manipulate the HTML content. Displayed documents are rendered and updated based on the DOM document object.

### Browser Cookies

- **Stateless Nature of HTTP**: HTTP doesn't maintain state across requests, which is not aligned with how websites are often used.
- **Purpose of Cookies**: To provide a workaround for the stateless nature of HTTP, cookies are used. Cookies enable the retention of user-specific data like language preferences or shopping cart contents.
- **Session and Persistent Cookies**: Cookies can be short-lived session cookies or can have extended lifetimes as persistent cookies.
- **Setting Multiple Cookies**: A server can set multiple cookies by using multiple `Set-Cookie` headers in a single HTTP response.
- **Scope of Cookies**: Cookies can be set to be returned only on later visits to the same server, or depending on their attributes, to other hosts as well.

#### Example of Setting Cookies

- **Two Cookies Example**: The section provides an example where two cookies named `sessionID` and `language` are set with different attributes. One is aimed for all pages under the domain `mystore.com` and the other is confined to a specific path `/faculties` and is set as HttpOnly.

### Cookie Attributes

- **Max-Age and Expires**: To set an expiration time for cookies, `Max-Age` or `Expires` attributes are used.
- **Domain Attribute**: Specifies which hosts will receive the cookie. The default is the origin server.
- **Path Attribute**: Specifies which pages under the origin server will receive the cookie.
- **Secure Attribute**: Indicates the cookie should only be sent over HTTPS.
- **HttpOnly Attribute**: Specifies that the cookie is only accessible via HTTP and not through client-side scripts.

#### Example of Returning HTTP Cookies

- **Path Scope**: It talks about what happens when a cookie is set without Domain or Path attributes, specifying that the cookie will only be available to the path that set it.

### Additional Details on Cookies

- **DOM API and Cookies**: Discusses `document.cookie`, which returns all cookies for the current document.
- **Evicting Cookies**: Explains that a new cookie will replace an existing one if they have the same name, Domain attribute, and Path attribute.
- **Disabling Cookies**: Mentions `navigator.cookieEnabled`, a boolean property used by browsers to track whether cookies are enabled or not.
