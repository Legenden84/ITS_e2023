# 9.4 Same-origin policy (DOM SOP)

The text covers the topic of the Same-origin Policy (SOP) with respect to Document Object Model (DOM) in web development, breaking it down into various subtopics and discussing its implementation, motivation, and implications.

## Introduction and Philosophy
- SOP is presented as an isolation and access control mechanism aimed at safeguarding documents from different origins from interfering with one another.
- The text refers to Principle P5 (ISOLATED-COMPARTMENTS) as the spirit behind SOP.

## Motivation for SOP
- A hypothetical situation is described where a browser can load HTML documents from two different domains (host1 and host2). Without SOP, JavaScript from host1 could manipulate or access data from host2, leading to security risks.
- Discusses trade-offs: overly strict policies might hamper interactions between cooperating subdomains or disrupt the Internet advertising model.
- Points out that HTML's `<script>` tag and `src=` attribute allow for embedding JavaScript from any domain, increasing both utility and risk.

## Basic SOP Rules (DOM SOP)
- Base HTML document is assigned an origin, derived from the URI that fetched it.
- Scripts and images inherit the origin of the HTML document that causes them to be loaded.
- Scripts can generally access content whose assigned origin matches their own.

## Challenges and Vulnerabilities
- Highlights the difficulties in enforcing SOP, capturing its essence, and balancing it against the utility of resource sharing.
- Notes that browser-server interactions can still be vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

## Origin Triplet Rule
- Defines the "origin triplet" as a combination of the scheme, host, and port.
- Describes that JavaScript in an HTML document can access all resources assigned the same origin but not the content or DOM properties from a different origin.

## Relaxing SOP by `document.domain`
- Developers can loosen SOP by altering `document.domain` to allow scripts from different subdomains to interact.
- However, this is considered a security risk as it makes DOM objects accessible to all subdomains of the modified suffix.

## SOP for Cookies
- Introduces a different set of SOP rules specifically for cookies.
- Here, port is excluded from the origin triplet.
- Mentions attributes like Secure and HttpOnly which play roles similar to the scheme in the DOM SOP triplet.

## SOP for Plugin-Specific Active Content
- Discusses the SOP as it relates to content targeted at specific browser plugins like Java, Macromedia Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and Adobe Reader.
- Notes the high number of security exploits with plugins and mentions that their use is declining due to alternatives like HTML5.

## Browser Extensions
- Differentiates between plugins and browser extensions, stating the latter modify browser functionality but don't render novel types of content.

## Exercise on Java Security
- Presents an exercise that asks the reader to summarize Java's security model and its implications for Java applets.

## SOP and AJAX
- Discusses another use case of SOP in controlling Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) requests.
- Notes that AJAX requests are restricted by the DOM SOP to the origin server.
