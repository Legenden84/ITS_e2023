# Detailed Resume of Chapter 1: Security Concepts and Principles

## Overview

The chapter aims to introduce the core concepts and principles surrounding the field of computer and Internet security. It provides an in-depth understanding of what the term 'computer' encompasses in the modern age, the types of network devices and servers, and how these can be both secure and insecure. The chapter sets the stage by listing the primary objectives of computer security and goes on to discuss design principles for implementing a secure system.

## Scope

- **Computing Devices**: Personal Computers, Laptops, Tablets, Smartphones
- **Servers**: Front-end servers hosting websites, Back-end servers containing databases
- **Network Devices**: Firewalls, Routers, Switches
- **Communication Links**: Internet, intranet, and other data transfer protocols
- **Human Interaction**: How people use and interact with computing resources
- **Security Risks**: Potential misuse by various agents (hackers, insider threats, etc.)

## Objectives of Computer Security

The chapter begins by highlighting the primary goals or fundamental objectives that computer security aims to achieve. These are often framed as security services rendered to users and other components of the system.

### Security Services

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized parties.
- **Integrity**: Making sure that data is accurate and has not been tampered with.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that resources are available when needed.
- **Non-Repudiation**: Guaranteeing that parties in a communication cannot deny the authenticity of the messages exchanged.
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the parties involved in a communication.

## Design Principles for Security

The latter part of the chapter delves into the various design principles that are instrumental in building secure systems. These are guidelines or best practices aimed at achieving the security objectives outlined above.

### Key Principles

- **Least Privilege**: Provide only the minimum levels of access — or permissions — necessary to perform a function.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Base access decisions on permission rather than exclusion.
- **Economy of Mechanism**: Keep the design as simple and small as possible.
- **Complete Mediation**: Every access to every object must be checked for authority.
- **Open Design**: The design should not be secret but should be open for scrutiny.
- **Separation of Privilege**: Where possible, a protection mechanism that requires two keys is stronger than one that requires only one.
- **Least Common Mechanism**: Minimize the amount of mechanism common to more than one user.
- **Psychological Acceptability**: It should be easy to use the security mechanisms, so users readily accept them.

## Additional Elements

- **User Interaction**: Discusses how the human element can often be the weakest link in a secure system.
- **Potential Misuse**: Highlights the vulnerabilities that could be exploited by various agents, including hackers, state actors, and even employees.

## Conclusion

The chapter serves as a foundational guide to understanding the complexities of computer and Internet security. It outlines the critical objectives that any secure system should meet and discusses the design principles that can help in achieving these objectives. Understanding these concepts is essential for anyone involved in the creation, implementation, or usage of secure computer systems.
