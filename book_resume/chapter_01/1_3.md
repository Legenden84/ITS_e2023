# 1.3 Risk, risk assessment, and modeling expected losses

## Introduction
The text delves into the critical importance of understanding and assessing risks related to computer security. It differentiates between quantitative and qualitative risk assessments, covers equations commonly used in risk modeling, and talks about the challenges and options related to risk management.

## Definition of Risk
Risk is defined as the expected loss due to harmful future events, relative to a set of implied assets and over a fixed period of time. It is dependent on threat agents, the probability of an attack succeeding (which involves vulnerabilities), and the expected losses if the attack is successful.

## Risk Equation
A popular equation to model risk is `R = T · V · C`:

- **R**: Risk
- **T**: Threat information, or the probability that specific threats will be instantiated.
- **V**: The existence of vulnerabilities.
- **C**: The asset value or the cost/impact of a successful attack.

## Example: Risk due to Lava Flows
The text provides an example involving lava flows to illustrate the concept of risk. Here, even if the vulnerability (V) and asset value (C) are high, the risk (R) will be zero if there are no volcanoes (T=0) nearby.

## Estimating Unknowns in Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is complex and requires specific expertise. Accurately populating parameters T, V, and C is difficult. For instance, combining different threats into one value (T) is problematic due to various probabilities depending on different agents (or adversaries).

## Modeling Expected Losses
Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) is modeled as `ALE = n ∑ i=1 Fi · Ci`, where `Fi` is the estimated annualized frequency of events of type i, and `Ci` is the average loss expected per occurrence of an event of type i.

## Fundamental Questions in Risk Assessment
1. What are the most valuable assets and their values?
2. What system vulnerabilities exist?
3. Who are the relevant threat agents and what are the attack vectors?
4. What are the associated estimates of attack probabilities or frequencies?

## Cost-Benefit Analysis
Cost of deploying security measures should also be considered. For example, if implementing a new password policy reduces monthly losses by $1000 but increases helpdesk costs by $2500, then the cost exceeds the benefit.

## Challenges in Quantitative Risk Assessment
Quantitative risk assessment is rarely possible in practice due to:
- Incomplete knowledge of vulnerabilities.
- Difficulty in quantifying the value of intangible assets like reputation.
- Incomplete knowledge about threat agents and their classes.

## Qualitative Risk Assessment
Most practical risk assessments are qualitative and involve rating the probability and impact of various threats against different assets. This helps organizations to prioritize their limited security budgets effectively.

## Risk Management vs. Risk Mitigation
The text concludes by stating that not all risks can or should be eliminated. Risk management options include:
- Mitigating risk with technical or procedural measures.
- Transferring risk through insurance.
- Accepting the risk if it is less costly.
- Eliminating risk by decommissioning the system.

| C (cost or impact)  | V.LOW | LOW | MODERATE | HIGH | V. HIGH |
|---------------------|-------|-----|----------|------|---------|
| V. LOW (negligible) |     1 |   1 |        1 |   1  |       1 |
| LOW (limited)       |     1 |   2 |        2 |   2  |       2 |
| MODERATE (serious)  |     1 |   2 |        3 |   3  |       3 |
| HIGH (severe)       |     2 |   2 |        3 |   4  |       4 |
| V.HIGH (even worse) |     2 |   3 |        4 |   5  |       5 |

Table 1.1: Risk Rating Matrix. Entries give coded risk level 1 to 5 (V.LOW to V.HIGH) as
a qualitative alternative to equation (1.2). V. denotes VERY; C is the anticipated adverse
effect (level of impact) of a successful attack; P is the probability that an attack both
occurs (a threat is activated) and successfully exploits a vulnerability.
