# 11.4 Denial of service attacks

## Overview

The text provides an in-depth explanation of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, including its various types, motives, examples, and potential mitigation strategies. It spans multiple subsections such as DOS, DDOS, Local vs. Remote DOS, false IP addresses, and other specific DoS attacks.

## Sections and Sub-Sections

### 11.4 Denial of Service Attacks

#### Introduction

- Briefly mentions that Sections 11.4 to 11.6 cover selected network-based attacks.
- Defines DoS as attacks that deny legitimate users the availability of resources and services by either degrading performance or causing failure.

#### Two Classes of DoS Attacks

1. Exploits latent implementation flaws (software vulnerabilities).
2. Exhausts resources (bandwidth, CPU, main memory, disk) through various methods like flooding.

#### DOS Motives

Lists six motivations behind DoS attacks:
1. Financial gain via extortion.
2. Competitive commercial gain.
3. Ideological or social activism.
4. Information warfare by nation-states.
5. Hacker experimentation for ego or peer recognition.
6. Vengeance.

### DDOS

- Describes Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) as DoS attacks distributed across numerous devices and locations, often utilizing botnets.

### Local vs. Remote DOS

- Differentiates between attacks originating from local hosts and those that require no prior access to the local host.

---

### Example: DoS by Poison Packets

- Discusses attacks that use malformed packets to exploit vulnerabilities.
- Provides examples like 'Ping of Death', 'Teardrop', and 'LAND'.

---

### False Source IP Addresses

- Describes how attackers often use false IP addresses to mask their identity.
- Explains that this makes the source more challenging to trace and block.

---

### Example: SYN Flooding

- Elaborates on SYN flooding as an example that exploits the TCP/IP handshake process.
- Discusses how it consumes pre-allocated resources without needing to flood the network.

#### Comments on SYN Flooding

- Differentiates between SYN flooding via true and false source addresses.
- Addresses the effects of using large numbers of compromised machines for SYN flooding.

---

### UDP and ICMP Floods

- Describes brute-force UDP and ICMP floods that overwhelm target bandwidth and CPU.

### Example: Smurf Flood

- Explains a specific type of ICMP flood that uses broadcast addresses to amplify the attack.

---

### Amplification

- Discusses how some DoS attacks benefit from protocol amplification, where a single packet triggers multiple or larger responses.

---

### Ingress Filtering

- Describes ingress and egress filtering as mitigation techniques against DoS attacks that use IP address spoofing.

---

### Example: DDoS Toolkits

- Introduces DDoS toolkits like the Tribal Flood Network (TFN) that offer various flood attack options.

---

### Exercises

- The text also contains numerous exercise questions aimed at testing the reader's understanding of DoS mechanisms, mitigation strategies, and examples.

---

## Summary Comments

- Emphasizes that while DoS attacks are easy to notice, finding a full solution is difficult due to both technical and social complexities.
