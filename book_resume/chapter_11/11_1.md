# Section 11.1: Intrusion Detection: Introduction

## Role of Firewalls and IDS

- Firewalls act as a coarse perimeter shield but are not sufficient alone.
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) act as the eyes, identifying what gets past the firewalls.
- Requires dedicated human resources for managing and monitoring.

## Basic Terminology

- An "intrusion" or "incident" is defined as an event that violates a security policy.
- Intrusion detection is the automated process of monitoring and analyzing system events to identify and report such intrusions.

## Detection vs. Prevention

- An IDS detects, logs, and reports intrusions. It may or may not include active responses.
- An IPS goes beyond passive monitoring and includes active responses like stopping ongoing attacks or altering network configurations.

## Architectural Types of IDS

- Network-Based IDS (NIDS): Monitors packets at a network level, often at strategic points like network gateways.
- Host-Based IDS (HIDS): Monitors operations and activities specific to a host, like file integrity checks, system call monitoring, etc.

## Event Outcomes and Error Rates

- Explains the possible outcomes of an IDS analysis: raising an alarm for an actual intrusion, false positives, and false negatives.
- Discusses the problem of high false positive and false negative rates.

## Example: Error Rates and Base Rates

- Gives an example using a hypothetical disease and a test that screens for it to explain false positive and false negative rates.
- Introduces metrics like True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and Alarm Precision (AP) and how they relate to IDS.

## Explanation of the Above Example

- Discusses how overlooking the low base rate can lead to misleading metrics.
- Equates this to an IDS setting, discussing how false positives can outnumber true positives in certain situations.

## IDS Implication of Base Rate of Intrusions

- Talks about the base rate fallacy in psychology, relating it to intrusion detection.
- Discusses the challenge of keeping both FPR and FNR low and how high false positives can render an IDS ineffective.

## Exercise: Classification Semantics

- A set of exercises asking the reader to define and describe terms like FPR, FNR, TPR, and TNR using probabilities.
- Asks to explain these metrics and to visualize them using a Venn diagram.
