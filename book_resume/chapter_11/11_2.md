# 11.2 Intrusion detection: methodological approaches

The text is divided into several sections and subsections discussing various aspects of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). It addresses the methodologies used in intrusion detection, offering an in-depth analysis and categorization of these methodologies into three primary philosophical approaches. Additionally, it provides exercises related to specific intrusion detection techniques and tools.

## Overview

The text opens with an introduction stating that Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) use a mixture of methods that span multiple approaches. Some methods may even fall under multiple categories.

## Three Philosophical Approaches

The text identifies three core philosophical approaches to intrusion detection:

### 1. Signature-Based Approach

- **Definition**: This approach searches for predefined attack signatures, which are pattern descriptors of known malicious behavior.

- **Trigger**: Matches to these patterns trigger alarms.

- **Pattern Complexity**: Simple patterns can be raw byte sequences or condition lists (fields to match in network packets). More complex patterns may use regular expressions.

- **Advantages**: It is noted for its speed and accuracy.

- **Updates**: Signature updates are continuous tasks that depend on known intrusions. Many Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can auto-update their signature databases.

- **Variants**: There are variants that generalize patterns by looking for side effects or outcomes of attacks, rather than strict pattern matching.

### 2. Specification-Based Approach

- **Definition**: For each protocol or application, an expert-defined specification outlines what behaviors are considered benign.

- **Verification**: A tool verifies if the behavior conforms to the specifications. Non-conforming events trigger alarms.

- **Advantages**: It can detect new attacks without generating false alarms for legitimate but unusual behaviors.

- **Challenges**: Creating these specifications and tools is time-consuming and protocol-specific, but universally applicable for all users. Lenient specifications can result in a high rate of false negatives.

### 3. Anomaly-Based Approach

- **Definition**: Builds profiles based on normal activity during a training period, using observed usage, audit trails, or logs.

- **Operation**: The approach focuses on identifying deviations from these profiles.

- **Features**: Profiles are based on selected features, such as the number of failed login attempts, files accessed, or CPU resources consumed.

- **Thresholds**: Anomalous behavior is determined based on thresholds for these features. Statistical tests can further validate the significance of deviations.

- **Machine Learning**: It is commonly incorporated into anomaly-based IDS.

#### Pros and Cons of Anomaly-Based Approaches

- **Strength**: Can detect previously unseen attacks.

- **Limitation**: High false positives due to abnormal but authorized user behavior.

- **Challenges**:
  - Feature selection efficacy.
  - Ensuring an intruder-free training period.
  - Risk of "Session creep," where intruders slowly embed malicious behavior.

## Exercises

### Exercise on Sequences of System Calls

- Focuses on using Unix system call sequences to define what is considered normal behavior. Anomalous sequences will trigger alerts.

### Exercise on Snort

- Snort is a signature-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).
- Exercises ask to summarize its goals, architecture, and features. It also asks to explain a Snort rule using a non-trivial example.

### Exercise on Bro (now Zeek)

- Bro is an open-source NIDS that supports both signature-based and anomaly-based detection.
- Exercises ask to summarize Bro's goals, architecture, and features, emphasizing its design goal of separating mechanism from policy to support all IDS approaches.
