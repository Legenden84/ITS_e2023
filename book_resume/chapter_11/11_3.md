# 11.3 Sniffers, reconnaissance scanners, vulnerability scanners

## Overview
The text is an exhaustive look at various tools and techniques associated with network security and vulnerability assessment. It categorizes these into sniffers, reconnaissance scanners, and vulnerability scanners. Each category is elaborated with its functionalities, capabilities, and ethical considerations. The text is segmented into multiple sub-sections, and some sections end with exercises or examples to encourage practical understanding.

## Packet Sniffing
- **Purpose**: Discusses packet sniffing as a method for capturing network traffic for analysis and storage.
- **NIDS and IPS**: Describes the need for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to process packets at line-speed.
- **Applications**: Outlines its uses for passive network monitoring and traffic logging for administrative or forensic purposes.
- **Risks**: Highlights that such tools can also be used maliciously, prompting the need for encryption technologies like SSH, TLS, and IPsec-based VPNs.

## Hubs and Switches
- **Ethernet LANs**: Explains how Ethernet is primarily used in wired Local Area Networks (LANs).
- **Hubs**: Describes that hubs broadcast packets to all connected devices.
- **Switches**: States that switches are smarter, routing packets only to destination devices.
- **Security Risks**: Notes that although switches offer better security, they can be compromised through ARP spoofing.

## Monitoring Support: Network Taps and SPANs
- **SPAN Ports**: Describes SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) as a designated port configured to duplicate traffic for monitoring.
- **Network Taps**: Discusses test access ports (taps) as dedicated hardware for passive monitoring.
- **Functionality**: Notes they don't have processors for intrusion prevention but merely serve for packet capture and monitoring.

## Vulnerability Assessment Tools
- **Purpose**: Describes tools that are designed to find weaknesses in your own network systems.
- **Categories**: Subdivided into reconnaissance tools, vulnerability scanners, and penetration testing tools.
- **Use Cases**: Emphasizes that these tools are used for both authorized vulnerability assessments and unauthorized exploitation.
- **Reports**: States that vulnerability scanners generate detailed reports, unlike penetration testing tools, which aim to actively exploit vulnerabilities.

## Limitations and Ethical Considerations
- **Snapshot Nature**: Notes that vulnerability assessments provide a snapshot in time and may not cover all potential risks.
- **Ethical Dilemmas**: Discusses the dual use of many of these tools for both ethical and unethical hacking. Questions the ethicality of releasing exploit modules.

## Port Scanning and OS Fingerprinting
- **Reconnaissance**: Explains that network-based reconnaissance often precedes an attack.
- **Port Scanning**: Discusses different states of a port (open, closed, blocked) and the use of scanning for inventory and policy compliance.
- **OS Fingerprinting**: Details the process and utility of identifying a remote machineâ€™s Operating System and its version.

## Tools and Examples
- **Nmap**: A tool used for a variety of network scanning tasks.
- **Nessus**: Focuses mainly on vulnerability scanning with modular architecture.
- **tcpdump and Wireshark**: Two packet capture utilities that use a standard packet capture library (libpcap).

## Security Concerns of Using Sniffers
- **Privilege Requirements**: Notes that some sniffing tools require root access, which could make them targets for exploitation.

## Practical Exercises
- Contains exercises related to scanning detection, architecture and functionality of older vulnerability scanners (COPS, SATAN), use of the Metasploit framework, Netcat, and complementary technologies to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

## Complementary Technologies
- Summarizes how firewalls, screening routers, and anti-malware solutions complement IDS systems.
