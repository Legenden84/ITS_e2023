# 11.5 Address resolution attacks (DNS, ARP)

## Section Overview

The text is a detailed technical examination of traffic-hijacking attacks that focus on Domain Name System (DNS) and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). It elaborates on how both types of attacks exploit a lack of REQUEST-RESPONSE-INTEGRITY (principle P19).

## DNS (Domain Name System)

### Basic Functionality
- DNS maps hostnames to IP addresses. It operates in a distributed manner, and no single host contains the entire DNS mapping database.
- Organizations are the authoritative source for their host IP addresses.
- The DNS protocol works on UDP port 53.
- Local DNS resolvers in an Operating System query one or more DNS servers to resolve hostnames to IP addresses.

### DNS Resolution Process
- Explains the hierarchical query structure, which may involve multiple DNS servers and levels of hierarchy.
- Discusses how data can be cached at various points for efficiency.
- Details the Time to Live (TTL) value for DNS responses that determines how long a cached entry is retained.

### Example of DNS Resolution
- Describes a step-by-step example involving a hostname `www.tgtserver.com`, involving an ISP's local and regional DNS servers.
- Explains both recursive and interactive query types.
- Walks through the role of global DNS root servers.

### Attacks on DNS (Pharming)
- Defines Pharming as falsifying the mapping between domain names and IP addresses, contrasting it with Phishing.
- Pharming is dangerous as even manual entry of the correct domain can lead you to an incorrect IP address.
- Emphasizes the lack of cryptographic protection in basic DNS queries and replies.

### Types of DNS Attacks
1. Local files: Tampering of local "hosts" file and DNS client cache by malware.
2. Intermediate DNS servers: Tampering of DNS caches by malware or internal threats.
3. Network-based alteration: Middle-person attacks that alter valid DNS responses.
4. Malicious DNS server settings: Risk especially high on untrusted networks.

### Exercise on DNS Attacks
- DNS Poisoning and Kaminsky technique.
- DNS attacks based on architectural domain exploited are also listed as exercises.

### Defenses
- Describes Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) as a long-term solution.
- Discusses challenges in deploying DNSSEC.

## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

### Basic Functionality
- Explains ARP's role in mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses on a Local Area Network (LAN).
- Describes ARP broadcast messages and the maintenance of a local ARP cache.

### ARP Spoofing
- ARP Spoofing is defined as sending false ARP replies to map an attacker's MAC address to a victim's IP address.
- Describes how this leads to poisoned ARP caches.
- Lists the reasons ARP Spoofing is possible: 1) lack of authentication in ARP replies, and 2) hosts accepting replies even when not requested.

### Defenses
- Static, read-only ARP tables can stop ARP spoofing.
- Discusses tools and other measures to detect and prevent ARP spoofing.
- Suggests an upgraded ARP protocol with reliable authentication as a long-term solution.

## Exercise Section

- Lists exercises related to different types of attacks and defenses that exploit REQUEST-RESPONSE-INTEGRITY.
- Compares DNS and ARP attacks technically.
- Discusses tools like dsniff and Ettercap for network-attack capabilities.

## Summary

The text serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding address resolution attacks, focusing on DNS and ARP. It elucidates the mechanisms of these protocols, the types of attacks that can exploit them, and potential defenses. Exercises are provided for deeper understanding and exploration.
