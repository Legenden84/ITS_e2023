# 11.6 TCP session hijacking

## Introduction

The text primarily focuses on TCP Session Hijacking, its nuances, and possible countermeasures. It first introduces the concept, describing it as a manipulation of unencrypted TCP sessions by an on-path attacker. The main hurdle for the attacker is bypassing the TCP sequence number mechanism. The text further elaborates that the attacker doesn't need host access or privileges to conduct such an attack, and mentions two variations of how an attack can occur.

## Hijacking and Related Attacks

The text distinguishes TCP session hijacking from three other types of attacks:

1. HTTP session hijacking via cookie theft
2. Middle-person attacks on Diffie-Hellman key agreement
3. ARP spoofing

It also mentions that middle-person attacks involving TLS may use DNS-based misdirection in conjunction with fraudulent website certificates.

## Technical Background on TCP Sequence Numbers

The text provides a deep dive into the role of TCP sequence numbers, which are critical for maintaining the byte stream between connected systems. During the TCP handshake, both ends choose a new Initial Sequence Number (ISN). Sequence numbers are critical in TCP session hijacking and also in RST attacks.

## Context of TCP Session Hijacking

Here, the text explores the nuances of sequence numbers in the context of hijacking. An attacker aims to craft packets with valid sequence numbers according to the receiver's TCP state machine. The text highlights that these sequence numbers are designed for accounting, not for security.

## How TCP Hijacking Works: Outline

The text gives a step-by-step explanation of how an attacker (T) could exploit a TCP connection between two hosts (A and B). T sniffs packet details and injects malicious packets, possibly manipulating sequence numbers to make the packets appear legitimate.

### Side Effect 1: Desynchronization

The text explains that the attacker may inadvertently cause desynchronization between A and B by tampering with sequence numbers. The attacker may also intentionally desynchronize A and B, acting as a middle-person and modifying the contents of the packets.

### Side Effect 2: ACK Storms

Here, the text describes a byproduct of TCP hijackingâ€”ACK storms. This occurs when both A and B continuously send ACK packets because they are out of synchronization.

#### Taming ACK Storms

The text elaborates that the attacker can manage ACK storms by either sending a Reset (RST) segment or employing ARP spoofing. Some TCP implementations may also rate-limit repeated ACKs to control storms.

## Blind TCP Reset Attacks

The text introduces another concept related to TCP hijacking, called "Blind TCP Reset Attacks." These are Denial of Service (DoS) attacks where the attacker must guess the sequence numbers rather than observing them.

## Mitigating Measures

Finally, the text mentions mitigating strategies to counter TCP-based attacks, including encryption technologies like SSH, TLS, and IPsec. It also refers to RFC 5961, which provides updates to the TCP specification to combat off-path attacks.
