# 12.3 Security architecture: access control, EAP and RADIUS

The provided text is a comprehensive examination of 802.11 WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) security architecture. It delves into numerous facets of access control, EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol), and RADIUS (Remote Access Dial-In User Service). Below are the key points covered in the text:

## 1. Security Framework and Stages
- **Low-Level Authentication**: A precursor to the security architecture, discussing layer 2 access control mechanisms.
- **Four-Piece Security**: Breaks down WLAN security into four distinct stages:
  1. **802.1X Management and Authentication Framework**: Introduces EAP and RADIUS as enabling a variety of upper-layer authentication methods. 802.1X access control is conditioned on authentication success.
  2. **Upper-Layer Authentication**: Describes two possible approaches:
    - Using an external Authentication Server (AS).
    - Embedding modest AS functionalities in the Access Points (APs) themselves.
  3. **Four-Pass Handshake**: A protocol involving the Station (STA) and AP exchanging parameters to prove they know the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) and derive session keys.
  4. **Per-Frame Data Encryption and Authentication**: Discusses encryption and integrity checks on a per-frame basis.

## 2. Dual-Port Access Control
- **802.1X Model**: Describes port-based access control where each STA gets two virtual ports in AP:
  1. **Uncontrolled Port (A)**: Limited to only authentication-related messages.
  2. **Controlled Port (B)**: Initially disabled, enabled post-successful authentication.

## 3. MAC Address Allowlists
- **Early Security Methods**: Discusses MAC address allowlists as a proprietary link-layer access control, highlighting its limitations against sophisticated attacks.

## 4. Networking Terminology
- Clarifies what it means when "protocol A runs over B" using the concept of a network stack diagram.

## 5. Role of EAP
- **Messaging Framework**: Explains EAP's role in STA–AP and AP–AS communications.
- **Various Methods Supported**: Indicates that EAP allows a wide range of authentication methods.

## 6. Role of RADIUS
- **Protocol Over UDP**: Points out RADIUS operates over UDP and relays EAP messages to AS.
- **PMK Transfer**: Specifies that RADIUS is also responsible for transferring the PMK from AS to AP.

## 7. EAP and EAPOL Messages
- **Message Types**: Describes the types of messages in EAP and EAPOL.
- **Transport Role**: Clarifies that EAP and EAPOL are primarily for transport, not security.

## 8. PSK (Predating EAP)
- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**: Discusses the limitations of the original 802.11 standard using static Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs).

## 9. Why Study WEP
- **Historical Lessons**: Argues for the study of WEP to understand the historical context and learn from past mistakes.

Overall, the text serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the multi-layered and multifaceted aspects of 802.11 WLAN security architecture. It covers everything from basic framework divisions, individual roles of protocols, message types, to historical perspectives.
