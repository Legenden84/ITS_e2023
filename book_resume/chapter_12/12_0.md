# Chapter 12: Wireless LAN Security: 802.11 and Wi-Fi

## General Overview

The chapter is devoted to the subject of wireless local area network (WLAN) security. The specific focus of the chapter is on WLANs that are built based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. Additionally, the chapter addresses Wi-Fi branded subsets of this standard, which are marketed for product interoperability by an industry association.

## Specific Points

### Standard in Focus: IEEE 802.11

The chapter emphasizes the security aspects related to WLANs built around the IEEE 802.11 standard. IEEE 802.11 is not merely mentioned; it is a cornerstone for the chapter's discussions and is analyzed in the context of its specific security ramifications.

### Role of Industry Association in Wi-Fi Branding

Wi-Fi, a term often used interchangeably with WLAN, is addressed as a branded subset of the IEEE 802.11 standard. It is managed by an industry association with the goal of ensuring product interoperability. The chapter outlines how this branding and standardization afford a valuable opportunity for a real-world study of WLAN security.

### Real-World Relevance

The chapter asserts that the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi branding offer a "rich opportunity" to delve into the practical security considerations of a major fielded system. The text aims to dismiss any critiques that might arise, suggesting that the issues and choices discussed are not hypothetical but are encountered in actual systems in the field. This point is critical for setting up the scope and relevance of the study.

### New Security Challenges and Opportunities

Wireless access brings forth new security challenges that are unique or at least different compared to wired networks. However, the chapter also suggests that these wireless networks can serve as a specific use case for applying standard security tools and mechanisms. This dual aspect of challenge and opportunity makes WLANs an interesting subject for study.

### Decision-Making in Security-Relevant Areas

One of the intriguing points the chapter makes is that when it comes to security, a plethora of low-level decisions need to be made. These decisions are security-relevant and crucial for the effectiveness of the overall system.

### Fallibility of Expert Committees and Large Corporations

The chapter underscores that design mistakes can occur at any level, even when international committees or multi-national corporations are involved in the development of widely deployed products. This observation serves as a cautionary note, emphasizing the need for rigorous scrutiny and analysis in the
