# 12.5 WEP attacks: authentication, integrity, keystream reuse

The text provides a comprehensive examination of various vulnerabilities and design flaws associated with Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), a protocol for securing wireless networks. Specifically, it delves into topics such as Shared Key authentication, keystream reuse, data integrity mechanisms, and initialization vectors (IVs).

## Shared Key Authentication

The text begins by explaining Shared Key authentication, a challenge-response protocol included in the 802.11–1999 standard. The protocol consists of four messages:

1. **STA → AP: auth-request**: The Station (STA) sends an authentication request to the Access Point (AP). The AP and Sequence Number (SN) fields are fixed, with the Info Element left empty.
2. **STA ← AP: auth-challenge**: The AP responds with a plaintext challenge composed of 128 bytes.
3. **STA → AP: auth-response**: The STA returns an encrypted form of the challenge.
4. **STA ← AP: auth-status**: The AP sends back a status code, indicating success if the Integrity Check Value (ICV) is correct and the decrypted challenge matches the original.

## Keystream Stripping Attack

The text describes an attack where an eavesdropper can recover the keystream by observing the plaintext challenge (`M`) and the encrypted response (`C`). The attacker can use XOR operations to recover the keystream (`S`). Because the choice of IV is left to the responder, the keystream can be reused for subsequent challenges. Shared Key authentication is thus deemed less secure than Open System authentication.

## Design Flaw Commentary

The text criticizes the protocol for allowing IV reuse, which implies keystream reuse. It emphasizes that this is a fundamental flaw because stream ciphers should never reuse keystreams. Additionally, the text warns against providing plaintext-ciphertext pairs as they can lead to known-plaintext attacks transforming into chosen-plaintext attacks.

## Additional Detail on Attack

The text elaborates on the attack by explaining how an attacker can recover the last 4 bytes of the keystream related to the ICV. This is achievable via XOR operations and the known Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) algorithm. The attacker does not need to know the master key (`K`).

## Keystream Reuse: General Case

Beyond WEP, the text discusses the general issue of keystream reuse. When two messages are encrypted with the same keystream, XORing the ciphertexts can reveal the XOR of the two plaintexts, compromising the encryption.

## Integrity Mechanism Failure

The text criticizes WEP's data integrity mechanism. It explains that the ICV (Integrity Check Value), a CRC based on the message but not any secret, is flawed. Even without the secret keystream, an attacker can undetectably alter the data.

### Detailed Explanation

A deep dive is provided to explain how the ICV can be compromised. The text outlines how an attacker can XOR a substitute string onto the ciphertext and then modify the ICV bytes to pass the integrity check.

## Full Attack Exploiting CRC Used as ICV

The text indicates that the attack is even more serious when considering that an attacker can compute a compensating value for the ICV without knowing the original plaintext. This relies on the linearity property of CRC functions.

## Lack of Independent Mechanisms

It highlights that WEP's design violates principles by having interconnected vulnerabilities. If one mechanism, like encryption, is compromised, it impacts the other, like data authentication.

## IVs in WEP

The text mentions the 24-bit initialization vectors (IVs) in WEP and criticizes the method for generating them. It states that 24 bits are insufficient to prevent IV collisions.

## Example of IV Collision

An example is provided to calculate the time it takes for a 24-bit IV to repeat, given specific network conditions. The text emphasizes that with newer Wi-Fi speeds, the risk is much higher.

The text concludes with exercises aimed at further exploring the discussed vulnerabilities and flaws.
