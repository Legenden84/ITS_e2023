# 12.8 Robust authentication, key establishment and WPA3

## Introduction
The text begins by discussing the unique security challenges posed by wireless links as compared to wired LANs. It recalls that the initial aim of the 802.11 standard was to implement a security mechanism known as "wired equivalent privacy" (WEP). However, the text notes that WEP failed to meet this aim due to various shortcomings.

## Recap on WEP
The section delves into the issues that plagued WEP, such as:
- Reuse of Initialization Vectors (IVs)
- Lack of automated key management
- Static Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs)

It attributes these design flaws to a lack of review by security experts, and notes that WEP's failure also lay in its inability to prevent message replay attacks.

## Evolution to More Robust Designs

### TKIP
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) is discussed as an interim solution developed in 2001 to replace WEP. The design was constrained by the need for compatibility with existing hardware and continued to use RC4 encryption. TKIP was eventually deprecated by the Wi-Fi Alliance in 2015.

### AES-CCMP
The text shifts focus to a more robust, longer-term solution, AES-CCMP, which emerged alongside TKIP.

### 802.11 Timeline and WPA
The text mentions WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) as a subset of 802.11 standards. It explains that WPA was an urgent effort in 2002 to replace WEP and was derived from a draft of 802.11i that included TKIP. This eventually led to WPA2 and later, WPA3.

### Mixed Architectures and Evolution
The section outlines a plan for transition from WEP to stronger encryption methods. It suggests a phased approach, where initially TKIP would be allowed, followed by a phase allowing interoperability between TKIP and AES-CCMP, and ultimately requiring AES-CCMP for all associations.

## Nonce Generation
It explains the mechanism for generating nonces (Number used ONCE) during the four-pass handshake. The nonces are generated using a pseudo-random function (PRF) and a variety of parameters like MAC address and time.

## Four-pass Handshake

### Overview
A detailed overview of the four-pass handshake in 802.11i is given. It serves to establish a Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) from a Pairwise Master Key (PMK). The handshake involves the exchange of random number nonces and features four messages (m1 to m4) that carry various parameters and are subject to integrity checks.

### Notes
The text lists observations about the handshake, such as:
- The Integrity MACs prove knowledge of various keys and nonces
- The IEs allow cross-verification
- The four-pass handshake confirms the liveness of the parties involved

## Group Keys and KeyID
The section discusses the need for Group Temporal Keys (GTK) for encrypting multicast messages. It outlines how GTK is derived from a Group Master Key (GMK) and how it is distributed to each STA during the four-pass handshake.

## Robust Security Network (RSN)
The 802.11i amendment in 2004 introduced the concept of Robust Security Network (RSN). The text enumerates various features introduced as part of RSN, like mandatory CCMP support and disallowing the Shared Key protocol.

## Exercises
The text presents some exercises related to the 802.11 WLAN security such as:
- Why group encryption keys are needed for broadcast
- Risks of shared and public Wi-Fi passwords

## Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE)
This method aims to improve security on open APs like those in airports and hotels. It uses an unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman exchange to establish session encryption keys.

## Method Categories
The text seems to indicate that it will go on to discuss different EAP methods, but this portion is not provided in the excerpt.

In summary, the text is a comprehensive coverage of the evolution of security measures in 802.11 wireless networks, highlighting the shortcomings of early designs like WEP and detailing the more robust protocols like TKIP, AES-CCMP, and WPA versions that succeeded it.
