# 12.7 AES-CCMP frame encryption and key hierarchy (WPA2)

The text discusses various aspects of the AES-CCMP frame encryption and key hierarchy under the WPA2 protocol for 802.11 networks.

## Introduction to AES-CCMP
The text begins by explaining how AES-CCMP improves upon WEP's RC4 stream cipher by using the AES block cipher. It sets the stage by stating that AES-CCMP is the core element of WPA2 and outlines that the section will describe how session keys are derived from the pairwise master key (PMK).

## AES-CCMP Frame Encryption
### Counter Mode and CBC-MAC
The text elaborates that AES-CCMP employs the AES block cipher in CCM mode, which consists of Counter mode (CTR) for encryption and CBC-MAC for authentication. It states that AES is utilized with a 128-bit key to handle both frame encryption and integrity.

### Two Components of CCM
1. **CBC-MAC**: This algorithm is used to generate a MAC (Message Authentication Code), which acts as an integrity tag and is appended to the frame data.
2. **Counter Mode (CTR)**: A counter block is initialized (serving as an Initialization Vector, IV), and each 128-bit plaintext block is XOR'd with the AES-encryption of the current counter value.

### Authenticated Encryption
The text notes that algorithms combining encryption and authentication are termed "Authenticated Encryption" (AE). In AES-CCMP, some MAC frame headers and CCMP headers are also authenticated but not encrypted, resulting in AE with Associated Data (AEAD).

### Mutable Fields
Fields that are mutable (subject to change) are zeroed out for MAC computation and verification.

## CCMP Header, PN, and CTR Mode Nonce
### Frame Body PDU
AES-CCMP adds 16 bytes to an 802.11 frame body PDU, with 8 bytes for a cleartext CCMP header and another 8 bytes for MAC integrity value.

### Packet Number (PN)
The text mentions that a 6-byte packet number (PN) is essential for detecting replay attacks and avoiding key reuse.

### CTR Mode Requirements
For CTR mode encryption, a 128-bit counter block is initialized, which requires a nonce value that must never be reused for the same key.

## Pseudo-Random Bit Generation
### HMAC-SHA-1
Pseudo-random functions (PRFs) are described as being used for key derivation and random string initialization. The HMAC construction based on the SHA-1 hash function is utilized for this.

### Notation
A specific mathematical notation `x hmac sha1(K,A,B,i)` is introduced for HMAC-SHA-1.

### Session Keys
For AES-CCMP, three 128-bit keys make up a Pairwise Transient Key (PTK). These keys are derived from the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) using a pseudo-random function.

## Replay Protection
### ReplayCounter
The text explains how AES-CCMP employs a 48-bit ReplayCounter, which is set to zero when a PTK is established. This counter is used to check for replay attacks.

## Exercises
1. **AES-CCMP Details**: The text poses an exercise question that asks for a detailed explanation of data integrity and encryption in AES-CCMP.
2. **Improvements Over WEP**: Another exercise question asks how AES-CCMP addresses the security flaws in WEP.

The text provides a holistic and deep-dive exploration into the technical aspects, mathematical underpinnings, and security mechanisms of AES-CCMP under the WPA2 protocol for 802.11 networks.
