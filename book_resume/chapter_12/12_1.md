# 12.1 Background: 802.11 WLAN architecture and overview

## General Overview

The section serves as an introductory background for understanding the architecture and essential components of an 802.11 WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network). It compares Ethernet technology with its wireless counterpart, discusses key components like mobile stations, access points, and authentication servers, and delves into network modes, frame types, and other specific aspects critical to 802.11 WLANs.

## Ethernet vs. 802.11

The text opens by providing a comparative understanding between Ethernet and Wi-Fi/IEEE 802.11. Ethernet is identified as the dominant technology for wired LANs, governed by the IEEE 802.3 standard. The wireless analogue to this is stated to be Wi-Fi, based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. Both are said to function similarly from a network stack viewpoint—essentially insulating higher layers from the data link and physical layers' details.

## Connectivity in 802.11 WLANs

### Role of Mobile Devices

Mobile devices like laptops typically connect to an access point over a wireless medium using specific radio frequency (RF) ranges. The access point is usually wired to a local network and thus provides Internet connectivity.

### Use Cases for Mobile Phones

For mobile phones, WLAN connectivity serves as a more cost-effective or reliable alternative to cellular network connectivity, especially when cellular service is billed on usage or reception is poor indoors.

## Key Components of 802.11 WLAN

### Mobile Station (STA)
A wireless endpoint or mobile station, referred to as STA, is identified as one of the main components.

### Access Point (AP)
The AP connects STA devices to a distribution system (usually wired), and it provides forwarding and routing services.

### Authentication Server (AS)
An AS is a component that may be integrated into the AP for simple designs (like home networks). It often uses basic username-password lists and is central to more advanced authentication mechanisms discussed later in the text.

## Network Modes

### Infrastructure Mode
The primary focus is on what is called 'infrastructure mode', which involves one or more Access Points (APs).

### Basic Service Set (BSS) and Extended Service Set (ESS)
In infrastructure mode, a Basic Service Set (BSS) consists of an AP and one or more STAs. An Extended Service Set (ESS) is formed when two or more BSSs are connected by a distribution system (DS).

### Ad Hoc Mode
The text also briefly describes an alternate mode, called the 'ad hoc mode,' where STAs connect directly to each other, forming an Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) with no connection to a DS or any other network.

## Types of Frames in 802.11

1. **Data Frames**: These are the highest-level frames carrying upper-layer protocol data and authentication messages.
2. **Management Frames**: These include messages related to beacons, probes, and low-level, non-cryptographic authentication. They are essential for setting up new STA-AP connections and facilitating handovers between APs.
3. **Control Frames**: These are the lowest-level frames concerned with accessing the wireless media.

## SSIDs and MAC Addresses

The text clarifies that Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) are not secrets, as they are visible in plaintext in management frames. This directly impacts their utility as an access control mechanism. Additionally, the structure of an 802.11 frame includes 48-bit source and destination MAC addresses, user data, and a CRC checksum.

## Broadcast Messages and Group Keys

In 802.11 infrastructure mode, the AP may send multicast messages; a STA wishing to do so communicates this to the AP, which can send the multicast on the STA’s behalf. Broadcast messages are encrypted under a group key shared by all local devices. The text states that group key management is important in the security architecture.

## Association Process

The steps to associate a wireless device (STA) with an Access Point (AP) are outlined, from sending probe messages to a final upper-layer 802.1X authentication.

## AP Security Policy

Information about the AP’s security policy and available options is conveyed through an Information Element field in beacons and probe responses. These policies can range from the use of an external AS to the types of supported security algorithms.

## Summary

Section 12.1 provides an exhaustive background on 802.11 WLANs. It establishes the fundamental components and modes of operation, describes the nature and types of frames, discusses SSIDs and MAC addresses, and outlines the procedures and policies that govern associations and security in such networks.
