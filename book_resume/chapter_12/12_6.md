# 12.6 WEP security summary and full key recovery

The text provides an in-depth analysis of the flaws and vulnerabilities associated with Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), a security protocol for wireless networks. It begins with a brief summary of WEP's design choices and their consequences on security.

## Observations about WEP's Design
The text identifies six observations concerning the design of WEP:

1. **IVs in Cleartext (D1)**: Initialization Vectors (IVs) are in plaintext and come before WEP-encrypted frames. This design choice doesn't pose a problem by itself but makes it easier to identify reused keystreams.

2. **Same Key for Multiple Mechanisms (D2)**: The same key is used for confidentiality, shared-key authentication, and data authentication (encrypted CRC). This introduces dependencies and new risks, including the possibility of a single point of failure affecting all aspects.

3. **IV Management (D3)**: IVs are 24 bits long and can be selected by the frame originator. This leads to unavoidable reuse of IVs, making it easier to attack the encryption.

4. **Direct Use of IV and Master Key for RC4 Seed (D4)**: Unlike modern cryptographic algorithms, WEP directly uses the IV and master key as the seed for RC4 encryption without any hashing.

5. **Shared Master Key (D5)**: In practice, many users in a WLAN share a master key. This sharing brings several risks, including enabling one user to derive keys used by others.

6. **Human-Chosen Master Key (D6)**: The master keys are often easy-to-remember strings, making them susceptible to dictionary attacks.

### Security Design Principles
The text then touches upon how WEP violates several established security design principles, such as modular design and safe defaults.

## Failures of WEP
The text highlights some severe failures due to WEP's design:

1. **Shared Key Authentication Flaw (F1)**: The shared key authentication is easily broken, allowing for unauthorized access and injection of messages.

2. **Data Authentication Mechanism (F2)**: The data authentication process is faulty and susceptible to replay attacks.

3. **Compromised Confidentiality (F3)**: The design choices compromise the encryption, making it easy to identify and reuse keystreams.

4. **Master Key Recovery (F4)**: The master key can be recovered through both brute-force and sophisticated attacks, resulting in a total security breakdown.

## Key Recovery Attacks
The text then dives into specific attacks designed for key recovery:

1. **Guessing Attacks**: Password guessing strategies often succeed, especially when human-chosen passwords are involved.

2. **FMS Attack**: Conducted by Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir in 2001, this attack effectively breaks WEP encryption by exploiting weak IVs.

### FMS Attack Details
It goes into intricate details about the FMS attack, explaining how it exploits the RC4 keystream to derive the master key one byte at a time, iterating over different sets of weak IVs.

### Attack Time vs. Key Length
It emphasizes that the time needed to perform these attacks scales linearly with key length, not exponentially as one might expect with robust encryption algorithms.

## Exercises
The text includes a series of exercises that ask the reader to consider various attack strategies, methods to optimize key recovery, and the evolution of WEP key recovery attacks over time. These exercises touch upon topics such as offline dictionary attacks, PTW attack, fragmentation attacks, and why certain workarounds were not promoted.

## Summary Comment on Key Management
The document concludes by emphasizing the crucial importance of proper key management in cryptographic systems and how WEP fails to meet this critical requirement. It laments the decision by the standards committee to overlook key management as outside of its scope, thereby enabling many of the security issues discussed.

Overall, the text provides a comprehensive breakdown of the numerous vulnerabilities and flawed design choices in WEP, emphasizing the importance of robust key management in cryptographic systems.
