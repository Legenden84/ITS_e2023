# 12.2 WLAN threats and mitigations

The text primarily focuses on discussing the vulnerabilities, threats, and mitigation strategies related to Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), specifically the 802.11 standard. The text aims to offer an educational framework for understanding the security challenges in WLANs and does not focus on a practical, hands-on approach for setting up wireless networks.

## General Context

The text begins by setting the context, asserting that it will focus on generic issues and recurring error patterns in WLANs. It emphasizes that historical case studies are important for the community to avoid repeating past mistakes. The author clarifies that the text is not intended to be a security analysis of newly fielded systems or a technician's guide.

## Security Challenges in WLAN

### Link vs End-to-End Security
The text notes that while there is a common wish for WLANs to be as secure as wired networks, achieving this requires extra effort due to inherent vulnerabilities in wireless networks. It points out that a WLAN is primarily about the link between a device and an Access Point (AP), and not about end-to-end communication. Hence, any protection at the link layer is removed when data is forwarded by the AP.

### Rogue AP and Session Hijacking
The text introduces two types of attacks:

1. **Rogue AP Attack**: This is possible when there's no mutual authentication between the AP and the Station (STA). The rogue AP can easily impersonate a legitimate AP and provide services to an unsuspecting STA. Mutual authentication and encryption can minimize but not entirely eliminate this threat.

2. **Session Hijacking**: This is possible when no encryption is used. An attacker can send a disassociation management frame to the STA, tricking it into thinking that it has been disconnected from the AP, thereby taking over the session.

### War Driving
War driving is explained as an activity where individuals scan for in-range wireless networks. This could be for the purpose of unauthorized use of an open network or reconnaissance. Different tactics for war driving, both active and passive, are discussed.

### Legality and Ethics
The text discusses the legal and ethical considerations, advising practitioners to obtain written permission before carrying out any scanning or network assessment activities.

### Monitoring and Manipulation Tools
The text describes the availability of tools that both security analysts and attackers can use for monitoring and manipulating 802.11 traffic. These tools can capture packets, replay, and inject frames.

### Denial of Service (DoS)
While acknowledging that stopping all forms of DoS is unrealistic, the text discusses the challenges of protecting against wireless DoS attacks. It mentions that attackers can disrupt wireless channels by radio jamming and that such attacks are generally easily detected.

### Loss of Physical Basis for Threat Models
The text highlights that wireless networks disrupt traditional physically-based threat models used in wired networks. For example, rogue APs are a constant worry in wireless environments, unlike in wired ones where the physical presence of an attacker is usually necessary.

### New and Heightened Risks
Finally, the text talks about the new and heightened risks associated with wireless connectivity, emphasizing that the convenience and cost-savings come at the cost of increased security vulnerabilities.

## Summary

The text serves as a comprehensive overview of the various threats and mitigations associated with WLANs, covering topics from the basics of wireless security to specific types of attacks and tools that can be used for both defending against and carrying out these attacks.
