# 12.4 RC4 stream cipher and its use in WEP

## Overview
The text is an academic-style discussion that outlines the RC4 stream cipher algorithm and its application in the Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol. The text is organized into different subsections that provide an in-depth look into various aspects such as the background of RC4, the mathematical underpinning of the algorithm, how WEP utilizes RC4, and issues related to the key size.

## RC4 Background

### State Vector S
- The text starts by discussing the RC4 algorithm, which uses a hidden state vector `S` that initially contains all values from 0 through 255.

### Key Setup Phase
- During a 'key setup phase,' this state vector `S` is rearranged based on a secret key.

### Keystream Generation
- As each keystream byte is output, the state vector undergoes further rearrangements. This is meant to make the output byte appear "randomly" chosen from the range `[0..255]`.

### Deterministic Output
- Despite the randomness, the keystream is actually deterministic for parties that know the seed value, allowing them to generate the same bytestream for decryption.

### Simplicity and Efficiency
- The RC4 algorithm is noted for its simplicity, as illustrated by the accompanying pseudocode. It involves only simple byte operations and is considered compact in design.

## Vernam Stream Cipher Construction
- The text explains that if `mi` and `ki` are the next plaintext and keystream bytes, then the next ciphertext byte `ci` can be calculated as `ci = mi âŠ• ki`. This is called the Vernam stream cipher construction.

### Decryption
- For decryption, an identical sequence of keystream bytes `ki` is generated. The plaintext byte is recovered by XOR'ing `ki` to `ci`.

## WEP Use of RC4

### Shared Symmetric Key K
- In WEP, a symmetric key `K` is shared among the Access Points (APs) and Stations (STAs) in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).

### Key Derivation
- Practically, this key `K` is often derived from a user-selected password and is infrequently changed due to the logistical challenges involved in updating all devices and APs.

### Payload Encryption
- The 802.11 data frame payload data, or MAC protocol data unit (PDU), denoted as `M`, is encrypted by adding two values before and after it. This resulting format is `IV D::M::ICV`.

#### IV and KeyID
- The Integrity Vector `IV D` is 4 bytes long, is not encrypted, and holds a 24-bit IV along with a KeyID byte.

#### Integrity-Check Value (ICV)
- The text mentions that ICV is a 32-bit CRC over the data and it is used for ensuring the data integrity.

### Seed s
- The seed `s` used for the RC4 keystream in WEP is constructed from `IV::K`.

### Frame Decryption
- Upon receiving a WEP-encrypted frame, the receiver uses the cleartext IV to reconstruct the RC4 seed, allowing for decryption and integrity verification of the received data.

## RC4 Key Size

### 40-bit and 104-bit Keys
- The 802.11 specification originally included a 40-bit WEP key to comply with U.S. export laws. However, many early products also supported 104-bit keys.

### Impact on Security
- The text argues that while a longer key increases protection against exhaustive key search, it doesn't significantly improve security against many types of attacks on WEP. For example, the ICV failure and keystream stripping attacks are not affected by the key size.

#### FMS Weak Key Attack
- It mentions that for some attacks like the FMS weak key attack, the increase in attack time is only modest or linear in relation to the key length.
