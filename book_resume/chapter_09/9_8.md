# 9.8 Usable security, phishing and web security indicators

The text is an in-depth examination of multiple facets of usable security, phishing, and web security indicators. Below are detailed breakdowns of its major sections.

### Introduction

The introductory section highlights the importance of merging usability and security, referred to as 'usable security.' It points out that this intersection is especially crucial in areas like user authentication and secure email. The text promises to delve into the context provided by phishing and browser security indicators and discuss relevant design principles and mental models.

### Phishing

This section outlines what phishing is and how it works. It describes a phishing attack as one where the user is lured into a counterfeit version of a legitimate website to gather sensitive data. Various tactics such as spear phishing, typosquatting, and the use of middle-person attacks are explained.

### Mental Models

This section discusses the concept of 'mental models,' which are the users' perceptions of how a system works. It highlights that incorrect mental models often lead to users becoming victims of phishing attacks. The role of social engineering in exploiting these incorrect models is also mentioned.

### Phishing Enablers

The text elaborates on multiple factors that contribute to successful phishing attacks. These include deceptive visual elements in the user interface, the simplicity of duplicating legitimate sites, and users' lack of understanding or attention to technical details like URLs.

### Phishing and Certificate Grades

This section highlights users' general lack of understanding about different types of web certificates, including Domain Validation (DV), Organization Validation (OV), and Extended Validation (EV). It points out that HTTPS alone is not a reliable indicator of a legitimate site.

### Phishing Defenses

This part focuses on methods to counter phishing attacks, such as spam filtering and domain filtering. It acknowledges that these measures have limitations and are not fully effective, particularly against short-lived phishing sites.

### Identity Theft

Identity theft is discussed as a severe outcome of phishing attacks. The text defines identity theft as taking over someone's real-world identity to obtain new credentials or make transactions.

### Security Indicators

This section reviews the various HTTPS-related visual cues used by browsers to indicate the security level of a website. This includes padlock icons and prefixes like "https" and "Not secure."

### HTTPS Encryption vs. Identification

The text argues that current indicators focus too much on the encryption aspect of HTTPS and not enough on the identification, which leads to user confusion.

### Summary and EV Challenges

The text sums up the role of browsers in providing security-related services and questions the effectiveness of Extended Validation (EV) certificates.

### Positive vs. Negative Indicators

The text talks about the industry shift towards using negative indicators for non-HTTPS sites, led by Google, to make HTTPS the default expectation.

### Usable Security

This concluding section ties back to the initial topic of 'usable security,' outlining challenges and principles for designing systems that are both secure and user-friendly.

### Exercises

Two exercises are provided at the end. The first exercise asks for a discussion on the pros and cons of integrating PAKE protocols with TLS and HTTPS for web authentication. The second exercise encourages a discussion on the effectiveness of clicking the padlock icon in browsers to review security certificates for making security decisions.
