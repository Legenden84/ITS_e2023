# 9.2 TLS and HTTPS (HTTP over TLS)

## Section Overview

The text begins with an overview section that explains HTTPS (HTTP Secure) as the primary protocol for securing web traffic. It describes the underlying technology, TLS (Transport Layer Security), and how it creates a secure channel over an established TCP connection to transmit HTTP data. This section sets the context by describing that HTTP requests and responses go through what is called a "TLS pipe."

## TLS Client-Server Channel Stages

### 1. Handshake Layer

The TLS client-server channel is divided into two main layers or stages. The first stage is called the 'Handshake layer', and it is further categorized into three functional parts:

- **Key Exchange (Authenticated Key Establishment)**: Establishes and finalizes all cryptographic parameters, including the master key.

- **Server Parameters**: The server finalizes all other options and parameters.

- **Integrity and Authentication**: This part is responsible for verifying the integrity and authenticity from the server to the client and optionally from the client to the server.

### 2. Record Layer

The second layer is known as the 'Record Layer,' responsible for protecting the application data using the parameters negotiated during the handshake.

## Key Exchange in TLS 1.3

- **Objective**: The goal is to establish a master key, a shared secret between the client and server.

- **Methods**:
  1. **Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE)**: Uses either finite fields or elliptic curves.
  2. **Pre-shared Key (PSK) Alone**: Identified by a PSK-label.
  3. **PSK Combined with DHE**: Merges the functionalities of PSK and DHE.

- **PSK Details**: PSK can be a long-term secret or a key from an earlier TLS connection. It also mentions that PSK alone does not provide forward secrecy.

## Server Authentication in TLS 1.3

- **Methods**:
  - Digital Signature (RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA)

- **Client-to-Server Authentication**: It's optional in TLS, and often not used in HTTPS. If used, the client's "ClientAgain" flight includes a signature.

- **MAC Values**: Both server and client provide MAC values for integrity checks and key confirmation.

## Encryption and Integrity in TLS 1.3

- **Objective**: To provide a "secure channel" using authenticated key establishment.

- **Encryption Methods**:
  - ChaCha20 Stream Cipher
  - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in AEAD mode

- **Authenticated Encryption (AE)**: This method provides both confidentiality and data origin authentication.

## Session Resumption in TLS 1.3

- **Faster Setup**: A new session ticket may be sent by the server to the client for quicker session resumption.

- **0-RTT Resumption**: Explained as a method using PSK for resuming a session without a round-trip time.

## Exercises and Examples

1. **HTTPS Interception**: Asks to explain how middle-person type interception undermines HTTPS and its technical details.

2. **Changes in TLS 1.3**: Invites to summarize the key changes from TLS 1.2 to 1.3.

3. **Replay Protection in TLS 1.3**: Asks to explain special measures needed to prevent replay attacks in 0-RTT resumption.

4. **STARTTLS**: Describes various protocols that upgrade a regular protocol to run over TLS, mentioning it as an "opportunistic" use of TLS.

5. **Link-by-link Email Encryption**: Focuses on how email protocols like SMTP, IMAP, and POP use TLS.
