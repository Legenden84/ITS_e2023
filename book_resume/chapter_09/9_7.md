# 9.7 SQL injection

# Detailed Description of SQL Injection Text

## Overview
The text focuses on SQL injection, a prevalent type of security vulnerability often found in web applications. It talks about the underlying architecture of web applications that use SQL databases, explains how SQL injection attacks work, gives examples of such attacks, and discusses various solutions for mitigating them. The text also poses some exercise questions related to the defenses against SQL injection.

## Section Breakdown

### Introduction to SQL-Related Exploits
- The text starts by acknowledging the high frequency of SQL-related vulnerabilities in web security.
- It mentions that web applications usually store data in relational databases, which use SQL as a standard interface.
- Server-side scripts construct SQL queries based on data from various sources, including user input, which should raise security concerns.

### SQL Injection Attacks
- SQL injection involves sending crafted or malicious data as input with the intention that the SQL server will execute commands specified by an attacker.
- The primary objective of an attacker can range from data extraction to unauthorized access and denial of service.
- The root cause is usually unsanitized data inputs that allow execution of unauthorized commands.

### Telltale Signs
- Input that changes the syntactic structure of commands, particularly SQL queries, is a sign of SQL injection.
- Scripts often use string concatenation to create SQL queries, which makes them vulnerable.

### Examples of SQL Injection
1. **First Example**
    - Explains a situation where a user logs into a website and inputs a username and password.
    - These credentials are used to create an SQL query for authentication.
    - The example then shows how entering a specially crafted username (like `root' --`) can result in SQL query manipulation, bypassing the password requirement.

2. **Second Example**
    - Discusses another method involving an always-true OR condition.
    - Shows how entering a username like `â€™OR 1=1 --` can leak all records of the table.

### SQL and Single-Quotes
- Talks about the ambiguity caused by single quotes in SQL syntax.
- Different SQL variants have their methods to escape single quotes, but these are not sufficient to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### Input Sanitization
- Discusses various strategies for mitigating SQL injection attacks.
    - **Escaping**: Remove a subset of identified problems from the received input.
    - **Input Filtering by Denylists**: Reject known-bad input or prohibited keywords.
    - **Positive Validation**: Allow only preapproved input via allowlists and data validation.

### Exercises
1. **SQL Injection Programming Defenses**
    - Asks to describe different types of SQL injection defenses listed by OWASP, such as prepared statements, stored procedures, input validation, and escaping.

2. **SQL Injection Mitigation Systems**
    - Requests summaries on the designs and drawbacks of different SQL injection defense mechanisms like AMNESIA, SQLCheck, SQLGuard, and WebSSARI.
