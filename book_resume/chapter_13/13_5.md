# 13.5 Mining of blocks, block preparation and hashing targets

The text is a comprehensive guide to Bitcoin mining, focusing on the processes involved in the preparation and validation of blocks before they are added to the blockchain. The document is divided into multiple subsections, each tackling a distinct aspect of the mining process.

## Overview of Mining and Block Preparation

The text begins with a simplified overview of how mining works. It explains that Bitcoin transactions are sent to a peer-to-peer network where miners compete to prepare blocks that meet certain criteria. These blocks, when confirmed, get added to the blockchain. Miners use a memory pool to store pending transactions from which they select a subset for inclusion in a new block. The block header is prepared by calculating a Merkle root from these transactions.

The miners must complete a computational task to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The text notes that the task is performed by a loop that iteratively searches for a hash output with a numerical value below a specific threshold, referred to as the "mining bound." This mining bound is periodically adjusted to maintain the block production rate.

## Block Mining Pseudocode

The document then goes on to present pseudocode to describe the mining process. The pseudocode emphasizes two loops: an inner loop that increments a 'mining nonce' and an outer loop that updates a timestamp. The SHA-256 hashing function is used for mining and validation.

## Preparing a Block Header

Here, the text enumerates the six fields that need to be prepared for the block header:

1. **Version**: Either 1 or 2 at the time of writing.
2. **Prev-block-hash**: The hash of the current top block in the blockchain.
3. **Merkle Root**: Calculated after selecting transactions from the miner's memory pool.
4. **Timestamp**: In Unix format; assumes the inner loop takes at least one second.
5. **Mining Bound**: A 4-byte form target for the hash.
6. **Mining Nonce**: Serves as a counter and the final value allows the hash to satisfy the mining bound.

## Nonce Solutions and Memory Pool

The text explains that miners are not looking for the same nonce solutions, as each miner has unique transactions in their memory pools. When a miner confirms a block, the transactions in that block are removed from the miner's memory pool. Transactions that become ineligible due to the new block are also filtered out.

## Prioritizing Memory Pool Transactions

Miners prioritize transactions based on a formula that accounts for the transaction fee per byte of transaction size and other parameters. The document introduces an equation to calculate this "priority."

## Orphan Transactions

This section talks about transactions that claim outputs that don't yet exist. Such transactions are stored in an 'orphan pool' separate from the main memory pool.

## Mining Nonce and Loop (Details)

Further details are provided about how the 'mining nonce' operates within the loop to perform hashing tasks. The nonce starts at zero and is incremented until a valid hash is found.

## Mining Bound and Difficulty Adjustment

The text goes into how the mining bound is calculated and periodically adjusted. It involves the use of an 8-bit exponent and a 24-bit coefficient to determine a 32-byte hashing target. It also discusses how the bound is recalibrated every 2016 blocks to ensure a block is generated every 10 minutes.

## Relative Mining Difficulty

This part explains how the difficulty of finding a nonce for any given block can be expressed relative to the difficulty of the genesis block.

## Examples and Exercises

The document also contains specific examples to illustrate various calculations related to mining difficulty. It presents exercises related to transaction fees and the likelihood of successfully mining a block with a desktop CPU.

In summary, the text serves as an in-depth guide to the technical aspects of Bitcoin mining, explaining the intricacies of block preparation, hashing, and the addition of blocks to the blockchain.
