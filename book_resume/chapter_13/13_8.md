# 13.8 ‡Ethereum and smart contracts

# Detailed Description of the Text Content on Ethereum and Smart Contracts

## Introduction
The text provides an in-depth overview of Ethereum, starting with its introduction in July 2015. It positions Ethereum as a blockchain-based public ledger inspired by Bitcoin but extends far beyond to offer a decentralized computing platform for executing smart contracts. It aims to guide the reader through Ethereum's fundamental workings and its primary differences from Bitcoin.

## Ethereum’s Currency: Ether (ETH)
- **Creation**: Ether (ETH) is created through a block mining process similar to Bitcoin.
- **Transferability**: ETH can be transferred between accounts through transactions and can also be exchanged for other currencies.
- **Explicit Account Balances**: Unlike Bitcoin, which uses unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) for tracking balances, Ethereum explicitly tracks the balances of each account.
- **Nonces**: Ethereum employs "nonces" as counters to prevent replay attacks on transactions.

## Types of Accounts
### Externally-Owned Accounts (EOA)
- **Control**: Controlled by private keys.
- **Transactions**: Sends signed transactions for inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain.
- **State Values**: Identified by three values: `address, balance, nonce`.
- **Address Calculation**: The rightmost 20 bytes of the hash of the account’s ECDSA public key (KECCAK-256).
- **Balance**: Measured in 'wei', where 1 ETH = 10^18 wei.
- **Nonce**: Counts the number of transactions sent by the EOA.

### Code (Contract) Accounts
- **Control**: Controlled by an executable program called a contract.
- **Execution Environment**: Runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **State Values**: Identified by five values: `address, balance, nonce, acctStorageRoot, codeHash`.
- **Nonce**: Counts the number of contracts created by this account.
- **AcctStorageRoot**: 32-byte hash root that binds persistent storage to each contract account.
- **CodeHash**: Hash of the contract bytecode.

## Transactions and Messages
- **Initiators**: EOAs initiate Ethereum transactions.
- **Usage**: Transactions are commonly used to transfer value, invoke contracts, and create new contracts.
- **Transaction-to-Contract Interaction**: Transactions can result in messages being sent to other contracts, enabling interaction and state changes.

## EVM Execution
### Local Machine State
- **Three Types of Memory**: Run-time stack, EVM execution memory, and EVM persistent storage.
- **Program Counter**: Keeps track of the next byte of EVM code to execute.
- **Gas Register**: Tracks gas consumption.
- **Operational State**: Defined as `(PC, GAS, exec mem, stack, current code)`.

### Gas and Fees
- **Gas-Limited Computation**: To prevent infinite loops and abuse, the computation is constrained by gas limits.
- **Fee Model**: Designed to protect against both malicious actions and benign errors.
- **Gas Price**: Not fixed; set by the transaction and accepted by miners.

## Transaction Fields
- **Fields**: Include `toAddr, valueTo, data, nonce, gasLimit, gasPrice, sendersSig`.
- **ToAddr**: Receiver’s account address or `NULL` for contract creation.
- **ValueTo**: Amount to transfer, also used for initializing new contracts.
- **Data**: Provides input to contracts for messages or startup code for new contracts.
- **Nonce**: Compared against the account’s nonce to prevent replays.
- **GasLimit and GasPrice**: Defines the cost limits and cost per unit of gas.
- **SendersSig**: Provides data allowing verification of the sender’s signature.

## Receipts and Execution Logs
- **Logging Opcodes**: Specific opcodes in the EVM used for logging information related to contract execution.
- **Receipts**: Generated for each transaction involving contracts, containing status codes and logs.

## EVM Fee Schedule
- **Resource Costing**: Gas charges are based on instruction complexity or system costs.
- **Who Pays**: The invoking transaction covers the gas costs, not the contract itself.

## Mining Rewards
- **Block Reward**: Typically 2 ETH, plus additional rewards for including 'ommer' blocks.
- **Ommer Block Rewards**: Calculated based on how many generations older the ommer block is compared to the mined block.
- **Long-Term Plan**: Unlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed end-date for block rewards, Ethereum’s approach is more ad hoc.

# Detailed Description of the Text Content on Ethereum

## Block Headers, Complete Blocks, and Ommers

- This section provides a comprehensive explanation of the fields present in an Ethereum block header. These fields are organized in Table 13.7 and Fig. 13.11.
- A full block in Ethereum consists of three main components:
    1. Block header
    2. List of ommer block headers
    3. Sequence of transactions
- The term "ommer" is introduced as a gender-neutral term for "uncle," meaning a sibling of a main-chain block that did not end up on the main chain.
- Ommers are important in Ethereum's consensus protocol, which doesn't just select the longest chain, but the heaviest chain.
- Miners get extra rewards for including up to 2 ommer block headers from the past 6 generations of blocks.
- The incentive to include ommers aims to mitigate attacks enabled by frequent blockchain forks, contrasting Ethereum's 13-14 second block production time with Bitcoin's 10 minutes.

## Transaction Validation and Execution

- To be considered legitimate, Ethereum transactions must undergo a validation and execution process.
- This process consists of several steps:
    1. Transaction validity checks, such as format verification, sender's signature verification, and nonce checks.
    2. Transferring the specified value from the sender to the receiver.
    3. Deduction of `gasLimit * gasPrice` from the sender's balance and incrementing the sender's nonce.
    4. Setting the gas limit for the transaction.
    5. Deducting intrinsic gas costs.
    6. If the recipient address is a contract, executing its code until the contract code exits or runs out of gas.
    7. Handling exceptions such as insufficient funds and restoring state if exceptions occur.

## World State and the Blockchain

- Ethereum maintains a "world state," which is an authenticated data structure storing data about Ethereum accounts.
- The state is not fully stored on the blockchain but is verifiable via block headers.
- Ethereum blocks are 500 bytes, compared to Bitcoin's 80 bytes, due to Ethereum's complex data structures.

## Ethereum MPT (Merkle Patricia Tree)

- Describes how Ethereum uses a custom Merkle Patricia Tree (MPT) to store and update its world state.
- MPTs are authenticated data structures, and their root hashes can authenticate an entire dataset.
- Account addresses can be used to look up various data points like balance, nonce, storage root, and code hash.
- Transaction roots are indexed by transaction numbers in a block.

## Transactional State Machine

- Explains that Ethereum transactions cause state transitions.
- Discusses how each block in Ethereum defines a specific ordering of transactions.
- Notes that contracts only execute as a result of externally owned account (EOA) triggered transactions.

## Ethash and Mining Pools

- Discusses how Ethereum aims to prevent mining centralization through its Ethash algorithm.
- Notes that Ethash is designed to be ASIC-resistant and requires a lot of memory, with seed updates every 30,000 blocks.

## Programming Languages and Smart Contracts

- Lists the programming languages available for writing Ethereum contracts, including Solidity, Vyper, and LLL.
- Explains the vision behind Ethereum's smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).
- Categorizes prominent use-cases for smart contracts into:
    1. Financial contracts
    2. Games and digital collectibles
    3. Virtual property management
    4. Digital notarization
    5. Virtual gambling

## Exercises

- Suggests exercises related to Merkle Patricia Trees, The DAO, Namecoin, Non-fungible tokens, and the consensus model.
    - Each exercise challenges the reader to summarize or explain complex concepts related to Ethereum's architecture and use-cases.
