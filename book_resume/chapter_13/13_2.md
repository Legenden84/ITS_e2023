# 13.2 Transaction types and fields

# Detailed Description of "13.2 Transaction types and fields" Text

## Overview
The text focuses on explaining the structure, characteristics, and types of Bitcoin transactions, with an emphasis on their place within the Bitcoin blockchain. It aims to elucidate core concepts rather than focus on transient details of specific implementations.

## Sections

### Introduction
- **Blocks and Transactions**: Explains that transactions are grouped into blocks, which together form the blockchain. This provides the reader with the context where individual Bitcoin transactions fit in the larger ecosystem.

### Relating Inputs to Outputs
- **Transaction Flow**: Describes the flow of Bitcoin from a sender, who owns the input before a transaction, to a receiver, who gets the output after a transaction.
- **Input and Output**: Highlights that an input is essentially the output of a prior transaction.

### Regular Transaction (Data Structure)
- **Fields**: Discusses the different fields within a transaction, specifically focusing on a transaction with one input and one output as an example.
- **BTC-Value**: Specifies that the intended value of the transaction’s output is explicitly stated in the `btc-value` field.
- **Prev-out-txID**: Explains that the input value is implicitly stated, referring to an earlier transaction's ID through the `prev-out-txID` field.
- **Transaction Hash**: Mentions that the hash of the entire transaction serves as its unique transaction ID (`txID`), and this is how transactions are referred to.

### Example (Scripts and their Semantics)
- **Script Types**: Presents a common type of transaction with an unlocking script (`scriptSig`) in the input section and a locking script (`scriptPubKey`) in the output section.
- **Semantic Meaning**: Breaks down the semantic meaning of the scripts, explaining that the sender uses their signature and public key to claim an output from an earlier transaction and to specify the receiver’s address for the new output.

### Lock Time
- **Block Number and Unix Time**: Explains that the `lock-time` field can imply either a block number or Unix time depending on its value.
- **Transaction Delay**: Specifies how the `lock-time` field is used to delay a transaction until certain conditions are met.

### Exercise (Lock Time)
- **Non-zero Lock Time**: Suggests an exercise for the reader to look up possible reasons for using a non-zero lock time, such as allowing the payer to change their mind or making conditional payments.

### Coinbase Transaction
- **Special Type**: Describes the `coinbase transaction` as a special type of transaction that mints new Bitcoin instead of consuming output from a prior transaction.
- **Block Reward**: Discusses that the reward for solving a computational puzzle, called "proof of work," is conveyed through the `btc-value` field in the `coinbase transaction`.
- **Miner’s Choice**: States that the miner who solves the computational task decides where the block reward goes.

### Block Reward and Change
- **Transaction Fee**: Explains that any excess of inputs over specified outputs serves as a transaction fee.
- **Block Reward Calculation**: Specifies that the block reward is the sum of the block subsidy and the transaction fees.

### Bitcoin Unit Economics
- **Halving and Limit**: Talks about the ruleset that limits the total currency units to 21 million Bitcoin and the mechanism of halving the block subsidy approximately every four years.
- **Bitcoin Units**: Explains that the smallest unit of Bitcoin is called a "satoshi," which is one one-hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin.
