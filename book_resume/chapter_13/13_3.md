## Section 13.3 â€¡Bitcoin script execution (signature validation)

### Introduction
This section is a deep dive into how Bitcoin scripts work, specifically focusing on the validation of Bitcoin transactions. It begins by mentioning that scripts in Bitcoin are integral for transaction validation.

### Stack-based Machine Model
- **Concept**: Describes Bitcoin as using a stack-based computational model for processing scripts.
- **Conditions**: Notes that loops are not supported, and the running time is limited by the script size.
- **Token Handling**:
  - Binary Operator: Consumes the top two stack items, performs the operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
  - Unary Operator: Consumes the top stack item, performs the operation, and pushes the result back.
  - Operand: If it's an operand, it gets pushed onto the stack.

### Evaluating Input-Output Scripts
- **Transaction Validity**: For a transaction to be valid, all its execution scripts must evaluate to TRUE.
- **Script Joining**: Explains that an execution script is a concatenation of two pieces, `script1` (from the `scriptSig` field) and `script0` (from the `scriptPubKey` of a previous transaction).
- **Security Measures**: The script ensures the signature verifies mathematically and the public key hash matches that of the old transaction's key.

### Example (Script Execution)
- **Execution Steps**: Walks through the steps of how a Bitcoin script would process a 7-token sequence.
    1. Push `<sig1>` onto the stack.
    2. Push `<pubkey1>` onto the stack.
    3. Duplicate the top stack item.
    4. Pop the top stack item, hash it, and push the result.
    5. Push `<addr0>` onto the stack.
    6. Pop the top two stack items, compare, exit if unequal.
    7. Validate the signature.
- **Validation Entities**: Notes that various entities, including miners and payee software, carry out script validation.

### Writing Arbitrary Data to the Blockchain
- **Non-Bitcoin Use**: Discusses how Bitcoin's blockchain has been used to store non-Bitcoin data.
- **OPRETURN**: Introduces the opcode `OPRETURN` which allows the insertion of arbitrary data.
- **Provably Unspendable**: Transactions that include `OPRETURN` are unspendable and are removed from UTXO sets maintained by Bitcoin nodes.

### Exercise (Zero-value outputs)
- **Mining Policy**: Asks to consider a mining policy where transactions with zero-value outputs are included only if they have `OPRETURN` scripts.

### P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash)
- **Definition**: Introduces P2SH as an alternative to P2PKH scripts.
- **Redemption Conditions**: Specifies two conditions for redeeming payment:
    1. Hashes to the specified P2SH address.
    2. Evaluates to TRUE when combined with the locking script.
- **Complexity Isolation**: Notes that P2SH isolates the script complexity from both payer and blockchain until payments are claimed.

### Exercise (P2SH)
- **Tasks**: Requests to:
    - (a) Give an example of a Bitcoin locking script using `OPCHECKMULTISIG`.
    - (b) Use a P2SH address to give a set of redeem script, locking script, and unlocking script.
    - (c) List the advantages of using the P2SH version.

This section essentially serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding Bitcoin script execution, focusing on stack-based operations, script evaluation criteria, and specialized use-cases like P2SH and arbitrary data storage.
