# 13.6 Building the blockchain, validation, and full nodes

This section provides a comprehensive examination of how blocks are decided upon, validated, and added to the blockchain in the Bitcoin network. It dives deep into the decentralized consensus process that enables this.

## Block Propagation
- Miners, after successfully mining a block (completing the proof of work), send the block to their peer nodes.
- These peers independently validate this block.
- If it is valid, they add it to their local copy of the blockchain and then share it with further peers.
- Other miners are expected to abandon their current mining efforts for that block height and start afresh when they receive this new block.

## Transaction Validation
- Transactions propagate through the network to be considered for the next block.
- Full nodes validate these transactions based on five specific checks:
  1. **T1**: Checking the size of the transaction is within a specific byte range.
  2. **T2**: Performing sanity checks on the transaction format, including syntax and script structure.
  3. **T3**: Verifying that the value of transactions is non-negative, less than 21 million, and that the sum of outputs is less than or equal to the sum of inputs.
  4. **T4**: Checking the lock-time field to ensure the transaction is valid at the current time.
  5. **T5**: Checking the financial viability by ensuring that each claimed output exists, is unspent, and its locking script is satisfied by an unlocking script.
- These transactions are not re-forwarded if they have already been seen.
- Miners use these checks before adding transactions to their memory pool.

## Block Validation Checks
- Blocks must pass multiple checks to be deemed valid:
  1. **B1**: The total block size must be within 1-4 MB.
  2. **B2**: Sanity checks on block header attributes.
  3. **B3**: Ensuring that the block header satisfies the proof-of-work requirement.
  4. **B4**: The Merkle root in the header must match the hash of all transactions in the block.
  5. **B5**: All transactions within the block must individually be valid.
  6. **B6**: There must be a single coinbase transaction that claims the correct value.

## Main and Side Branches
- The blockchain consists of a main branch and side branches.
- The main chain is defined as the one with the greatest aggregate proof of work.
- Nodes may have different local views based on network conditions.
- Miners tend to build on blocks they receive first, causing temporary forks.

## Orphan and Unrecognized Blocks
- Blocks can extend the main chain, a side branch, or go into an "orphan block pool" if they have no recognized parent.
- Side branches may overtake the main chain or fall away.
- Blocks on distant side branches are eventually excluded, with their miners receiving no rewards.

## Confirmed Blocks
- As more blocks are built on top of a given block, it is considered more secure.
- Generally, a depth of six blocks is considered sufficient for confirmation.

## Coinbase Output Hold
- A special rule that prevents spending from the coinbase transaction until it has been confirmed `N` times (N=100 as of the writing).

## Incentive to Extend Main Branch
- Miners have a financial incentive to build on the main branch.
- This is because only blocks on the main branch yield block rewards.

## Non-compliance Risks
- If a miner includes an invalid transaction, their block becomes less attractive to other miners, affecting their potential rewards.

## Block Selection as Voting
- Each miner, in essence, votes for a branch to become the main branch by choosing to extend it.

## Example: Resolving Forks
- Gives an example explaining how forks in the blockchain are typically resolved quickly.

## Full Nodes and Mining Pools
- Full nodes validate transactions and blocks, and maintain the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) pools.
- Miners may form pools and share a single full node, making the ratio between full nodes and miners difficult to determine.

## Exercise
- Poses a question about what would happen if a miner tries to claim more block rewards than allowed.
