# 2.3 Public-key encryption and decryption

## Overview

The text primarily focuses on explaining the concept of public-key encryption and how it differs from symmetric-key encryption. It elaborates on how the keys are managed, the importance of the integrity of public keys, and the efficiencies achieved through a hybrid approach. Furthermore, it introduces the RSA algorithm in depth, including the mathematics behind it.

## Public-Key vs Symmetric-Key Encryption

### Keys in Symmetric-Key Encryption
- In symmetric-key encryption, a single key `k` is shared between two parties for both encryption and decryption.

### Keys in Public-Key Encryption
- In public-key encryption, each party has a pair of keys, labeled with subscripts to indicate to whom they belong.
- For example, Bob would have a key pair `(eB, dB)`.
    - `eB`: Encryption public key, which can be made public.
    - `dB`: Decryption private key, which should be kept secret.

### Practical Considerations for Private Keys
- Backup of the decryption private key `dB` may be prudent, but it should never be stored in plaintext in an untrusted location.

## Encryption and Decryption Procedure in Public-Key Encryption
- Alice wants to send Bob a message `m`.
    1. Alice obtains Bob's public key `eB`.
    2. She uses it to parameterize the public-key encryption algorithm `E`.
    3. She encrypts `m` to get ciphertext `c`.
    4. She sends `c` to Bob.
- Upon receiving `c`, Bob uses his private key `dB` to decrypt and recover `m`.

## Importance of Public Key Integrity
- The integrity and authenticity of the public key are critical.
    - If compromised, an attacker like Charlene could replace Bobâ€™s public key with her own, misleading anyone trying to send a secure message to Bob.

## Key Distribution Comparison

### Symmetric-Key
- For `n` users, it requires \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) different symmetric keys, which is \( O(n^2) \).

### Public-Key
- Each of the `n` users needs only one pair of public and private keys, thus requiring only `n` key pairs in total.

## Hybrid Encryption
- Public-key algorithms are slower than symmetric-key algorithms.
- A common approach is to use public-key methods to establish a shared symmetric key `k` for the session.
- The session key `k` is then used for efficient "bulk encryption" using symmetric-key algorithms.

## Mathematical Details: RSA Public-Key Encryption
- RSA involves two keys for each party: `eA = (e, n)` for public and `dA = (d, n)` for private, where `n = pq`.
    - `p` and `q` are secret large prime numbers.
    - `e` is an integer chosen such that \( \text{gcd}(e, \phi(n)) = 1 \), where \( \phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) \).
    - `d` is computed to satisfy \( ed \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n) \).
- RSA encryption: \( c = m^e \mod n \)
- RSA decryption: \( m = c^d \mod n \)
- Operations on these large numbers require specialized libraries like OpenSSL.

## Exercises
- There are exercises to illustrate RSA through examples and to prove that RSA decryption works as intended.

## Summary
The text comprehensively covers the basics of public-key encryption, particularly focusing on the RSA algorithm. It underscores the importance of key management and integrity, and also introduces the idea of hybrid encryption for optimized performance.
