# 2.7 Authenticated encryption and further modes of operation

## Introduction
The text delves into the subject of Authenticated Encryption (AE), and its various modes and forms, including AE with Associated Data (AEAD). It outlines how Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are integrated with symmetric-key encryption to achieve AE, along with additional symmetric-key cipher modes of operation.

## 2.7 â€¡Authenticated Encryption and Further Modes of Operation
### Authenticated Encryption (AE)
#### Definition
- Authenticated Encryption is the melding of encryption and data origin authentication.
- The objective is to ensure both the confidentiality and integrity of data.

#### Approaches
1. **Generic Composition**: Utilizes a block cipher for encryption and a separate MAC algorithm for authentication.
2. **Integrated Algorithms**: Custom-built algorithms perform both encryption and authentication. They safely use a single symmetric key for both functionalities.

### Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)
- AEAD allows the encryption of message data while also authenticating additional data that doesn't require encryption.
- Common Use-Case: Encrypting packet payload data while leaving header fields (like protocol or routing information) visible but authenticated.

#### CCM Mode of Operation
- Combines Counter (CTR) mode for encryption and CBC-MAC for authentication.
- Commonly uses AES as the underlying block cipher.
- Requires agreement on details like input formatting and MAC tag post-processing for security and interoperability.

#### ChaCha20 and Poly1305
- **ChaCha20**: A stream cipher with 20 rounds of an underlying cipher, ChaCha.
- **Poly1305**: A MAC algorithm designed for high security and improved performance, particularly in environments lacking AES hardware support.
- ChaCha20 and Poly1305 are often paired together in an AEAD algorithm.

### Examples and Parameters
- Table 2.2 provides examples of well-known symmetric-key algorithms, detailing their block lengths, key lengths, and other parameters.

## Exercise: Authenticated Encryption Generic Composition
### Three Methods
1. **MAC-Plaintext-Then-Encrypt**: Generate a MAC tag for the plaintext and append it, then encrypt both.
2. **MAC-Ciphertext-After-Encrypt**: Encrypt the plaintext first, generate a MAC tag for the ciphertext, and append it.
3. **Encrypt-And-MAC-Plaintext**: Input plaintext to both the encryption and MAC functions and append the MAC tag to the resulting ciphertext.

### Question
- Are all these methods secure? The answer requires a deep dive into cryptographic principles, citing various sources as hints.
