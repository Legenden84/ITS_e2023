# 2.4 Digital signatures and verification using public keys

## Overview
The text discusses the concept and applications of digital signatures, which are essentially tags accompanying messages and provide a secure method of authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation. Digital signatures mainly use public-key algorithms and are critical for securely identifying the origin of a digital document or message.

## The Function of Digital Signatures
- **Authentication**: Digital signatures provide data origin authentication. They assure that a message or file has originated from a specific individual who holds the private key needed to create the tag.

- **Integrity**: Digital signatures guarantee that the data received is the same as the data originally signed, thereby ensuring data integrity.

- **Non-Repudiation**: They also provide strong evidence of unique origination, making it difficult for the sender to later deny having sent the message.

## Signature Properties
Digital signatures offer three key properties:

1. **Data Origin Authentication**: They provide assurance regarding who originated the message.

2. **Data Integrity**: They ensure that the content received matches the content that was originally signed.

3. **Non-Repudiation**: They serve as strong evidence that prevents a sender from denying the origination of the message.

## Non-Repudiation in Practice
- The concept assumes that only the legitimate owner has access to their private key. Failure to secure the private key poses a risk and has been a barrier to replacing handwritten signatures in legal documents.

## Technical Details of Public-Key Signatures
- Public-key algorithms are used in a process similar to encryption but in reverse order.
- Algorithms S (sign) and V (verify) replace the traditional E (encrypt) and D (decrypt) algorithms.
- To sign a message `m`, a user employs her private key `sA` to create a tag `tA` using the equation `tA = SsA(m)`.
- The recipient can verify the message using the senderâ€™s public verification key `vA` and the equation `VvA(m0, t0A)`.

## Signature and Encryption
- The text poses an exercise to think through how one might both sign and encrypt a message, focusing on the order in which these operations should be performed and what data should be included in each step.

## Confusing Terminology
- The text advises against using terms like "encrypting" or "decrypting" when discussing digital signatures as this leads to confusion and potential misuse of keys.

## Digital Signatures in Practice
- For efficiency, digital signatures are often used in combination with hash functions.

## Conclusion
Digital signatures are a fundamental concept in cryptography that facilitate secure communications by providing robust methods for data authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. They have immense practical value but require careful management and understanding to be effective.
