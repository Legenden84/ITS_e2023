# Detailed Resume of Text on Message Authentication and Related Topics

## Introduction
The text focuses on the concept of Message Authentication, a cryptographic service that ensures data integrity and the identity of the data originator. It goes into great detail about the mechanisms, algorithms, and challenges surrounding message authentication.

## 2.6 Message Authentication (Data Origin Authentication)
### Overview
Message Authentication ensures that the data has not been altered and verifies the identity of the data's originator. This is achieved using a **Message Authentication Code (MAC)**. The MAC is a hash-like function that generates a tag based on both the message content and a secret key known only to the parties involved in the communication.

#### How it Works
1. **Algorithm**: The algorithm that computes the MAC tag is called the MAC function. This function uses the input message and a secret key to generate the tag.
2. **Secret Key**: The secret key is known only to the data originator and the intended recipient. This ensures the identity of the originator.
3. **Recipient Verification**: The recipient uses the received message and their copy of the secret key to compute the MAC and verify it against the received MAC tag.

### Limitations
- **Non-repudiation**: MAC does not provide a way to counter repudiation. That is, if Alice denies having sent the message to Bob, a third party cannot conclusively prove otherwise.
- **Public-key Signatures**: Unlike MAC, public-key signatures offer both data origin authentication and non-repudiation.

## MAC Details
### Algorithm & Key
- **Symbol Notation**: M denotes a MAC algorithm, and k denotes a shared MAC key.
- **Message Sending**: Alice wishes to send a message `m` and MAC tag `t` to Bob. She computes `t = Mk(m)` and sends `(m, t)` to Bob.
- **Verification**: Bob receives `(m0, t0)` (accounting for possible data modification). He then computes `Mk(m0)` using his copy of the key `k` and checks if it matches with `t0`.

### Freshness
- To ensure that the received message and tag are not replays of earlier communications, additional measures are needed to maintain "freshness".

## Example MAC Algorithms
1. **CMAC**: Based on block ciphers.
2. **HMAC**: A generic construction that uses a standard hash function like SHA-1, SHA-2, or SHA-3.
3. **Other Examples**: Poly1305-AES-MAC and those in AEAD combinations.

### CBC-MAC
- Derived from Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of operation.
- Designed for block ciphers and avoids the complexities of padding.
- Uses an initialization vector (IV) of 0 and retains only the final ciphertext block as the MAC tag.

## Exercises
### MACs from Hash Functions
- **Three Proposals**: Secret Prefix, Secret Suffix, and Envelope Method.
  - **Secret Prefix**: H1 = H(k1||x)
  - **Secret Suffix**: H2 = H(x||k2)
  - **Envelope Method**: H3 = H(k1||x||k2)
- **Security Concerns**: These methods are less secure than expected.

### MAC Truncation
- **Arguments For and Against**: The text suggests that the bitlength of MAC outputs can be truncated for technical reasons, but provides hints for arguments both for and against this practice.

### Data Integrity Mechanisms
- Outlines three different methods involving cryptographic primitives for providing data integrity on a digital file.

### Understanding Integrity
- Questions to ponder:
  1. Can Data Origin Authentication (DOA) be provided without Data Integrity (DI)?
  2. Is it possible to provide DI without DOA?
