# Resume of Chapter 2: Cryptographic Building Blocks

## Overview

Chapter 2 serves as an introduction to foundational cryptographic mechanisms that are vital in the realm of computer security. The chapter aims to equip the reader with basic understanding of various cryptographic elements, namely:

- Symmetric-key and Public-key Encryption
- Public-key Digital Signatures
- Hash Functions
- Message Authentication Codes

The chapter sets the stage for subsequent chapters that delve into more specific cryptographic and mathematical concepts such as Shannon entropy, one-time password hash chains, authentication protocols, and key establishment techniques like Diffie-Hellman. While it briefly mentions digital certificates, a comprehensive discussion on them is deferred until Chapter 8.

## Metaphor: Cryptography as Electrical Wiring in House-Building

To make the subject matter more relatable, the chapter likens cryptography to the electrical wiring and power supply in a house-building project. In this analogy, other professionals like framers, roofers, plumbers, and masons must have basic knowledge to avoid electrocution but don't necessarily need to understand the minutiae of electrical installations. Similarly, the primary objective of this chapter is not to teach cryptography in its entirety but to provide enough understanding of the best available cryptographic tools for specific tasks.

## Core Focus: Input-Output Behavior over Internal Details

The chapter stresses that its main focus is on making the reader, particularly those who are software developers, proficient in utilizing cryptographic toolkits. It prioritizes understanding the 'properties and interface specifications'—essentially the input-output behavior—of cryptographic tools rather than their intricate internal mechanics or algorithmic designs.

## Important Guideline: Do Not Design Your Own Cryptographic Protocols

As a cautionary note, the chapter advises strongly against designing one's own cryptographic protocols or algorithms. The rationale for this is likened to the principle that while an individual can plug in their own desk lamp, tasks like upgrading the electrical panel should be left to master electricians. The emphasis is on leveraging existing, vetted cryptographic mechanisms rather than attempting to reinvent the wheel.

## Deferred Topics

While Chapter 2 lays the groundwork, it indicates that more specialized topics such as:

- Shannon Entropy and One-Time Password Hash Chains (Covered in Chapter 3)
- Authentication Protocols and Key Establishment including Diffie-Hellman (Covered in Chapter 4)
- Detailed Discussion on Digital Certificates (Covered in Chapter 8)

are to be discussed in later chapters to provide contextually relevant knowledge.

## Summary

In essence, Chapter 2 serves as a comprehensive introductory guide to the cryptographic building blocks essential for computer security. It is designed to help software developers understand the properties and appropriate use-cases for various cryptographic tools without delving into the complex mathematics or designs behind them. Moreover, it offers important guidelines and cautions, underscoring the significance of utilizing proven cryptographic practices.
