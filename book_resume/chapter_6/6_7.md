# 6.7 Privilege escalation and the bigger picture

## Introduction

This section discusses how attackers often proceed with an initial exploitation, often termed as "base-camp code," to establish a foothold in a target system. The base-camp code might not be enough to accomplish the attack goal, and this is where privilege escalation comes into play. Privilege escalation means enhancing the capabilities or permissions of the initial code, allowing the attacker to carry out their end-goals. This is related to the principle P6 (LEAST-PRIVILEGE), emphasizing the idea that lower privileged processes pose lesser risks when compromised.

## Types of Privilege Escalation

### Examples of Escalation Levels

1. **Moving from fixed functionality to shell**: Transition from a program with set functionalities to an open shell that can execute arbitrary commands.
2. **Escaping sandbox environments**: Moving out of isolated filesystems or browser sandboxes to gain full filesystem access.
3. **Non-root to Root Escalation**: Executing code to switch from a non-root process to one running with UID 0.
4. **User-Space to Kernel Mode**: Elevating from root user-space privileges to kernel-mode capabilities.

### Real-world Example: Escalation via setuid

1. An attacker gains initial local access through a user-space shell.
2. They exploit a vulnerable root-owned setuid program by providing a carefully crafted input that includes shellcode.
3. This allows the attacker to spawn a new shell running as root, giving them superuser privileges.

## Privileges and Network Ports

### Privileged Ports

Systems often declare TCP/UDP ports 0-1023 as "privileged ports." Processes must run as root to bind to these ports, and they're generally trusted to provide non-malicious services.

### Daemon Vulnerabilities

If a root-privileged network daemon (e.g., SSH, FTP) is vulnerable, an attacker can exploit it to gain superuser privileges. The new shell spawned by the attacker would inherit the daemonâ€™s UID and its associated privileges.

## Common Mistakes Leading to Escalation

### Using Root for Regular Work

Regular work should not be conducted using root accounts. Root should only be used for tasks that require elevated permissions like configuration or software installation. When root accounts are used for daily operations, any compromise can lead to an immediate loss of superuser privileges.

### Binding Vulnerable Programs to Privileged Ports

Despite best practices suggesting that only well-vetted, secure programs should be bound to privileged ports, this is often not the case. This increases the risk of privilege escalation attacks.

## Remote Access Exploits

In a remote-access scenario, a similar procedure to local-access attacks is followed, but now the victim machine communicates with the remote attacker over a TCP/IP connection. The spawned shell as a child process inherits the network connectivity, allowing the remote attacker to execute commands.
