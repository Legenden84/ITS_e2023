# 6.4 Heap-based buffer overflows and heap spraying

## Introduction
The text expands the discussion from stack-based buffer overflows to heap-based buffer overflows and heap spraying. Unlike the stack, heap memory and BSS (Block Started by Symbol) have traditionally been writable and executable, posing a security risk. The text delves into how these types of memory areas can be exploited.

## Heap Memory and Data Segment
Heap and BSS areas are traditionally writable and sometimes executable. Buffers in these areas are allocated using declarations like `static int bufferX[4]`. Heap memory can be manipulated similarly to stack memory, but the memory allocation methods can differ across systems.

### Overflowing Higher-Address Variables
Attackers often seek buffers that, when overflowed, would allow them to corrupt higher memory addresses holding useful variables. For instance, overwriting a flag variable that controls access or corrupting a function pointer to divert program execution.

## Types of State Corrupted
Corruption could occur in multiple types:
- Stack-based pointers like return and frame pointers.
- Function pointers located anywhere (stack, heap, or static areas).
- Addresses used in C-language setjmp/longjmp functions.
- Data used in branching tests, affecting program flow indirectly.

## Generic Exploit Steps
Most buffer overflow exploits occur in three stages:
1. **Code Injection or Location**: Attacker’s code is inserted into the target program's address space.
2. **Corruption of Control Flow Data**: Buffers or other data structures are overwritten to set up a control flow transfer.
3. **Seizure of Control**: Control flow of the program is transferred to the code injected in step 1.

## Heap Spraying
This is a technique where multiple instances of an attacker's code are spread across the heap. Heap spraying often aims at exploiting browsers and may involve JavaScript. It's a way to accomplish step 1 of the Generic Exploit Steps, and it increases the odds of transferring control to malicious code. It's particularly dangerous because it works even in type-safe languages and can bypass defenses that randomize heap layout.

### Heap Maintenance and Security
Heap memory is managed in blocks or chunks, each having metadata indicating whether it's free or allocated. Overflows can overwrite this metadata, leading to arbitrary overwrites elsewhere in memory. Defenses may include secure heap allocators that can detect or prevent such overflows.

## Format String Vulnerabilities
Apart from overflows and heap spraying, the text also mentions a different class of attacks exploiting format strings in C’s `printf()` function. These attacks can also enable arbitrary memory read and write operations.

## Conclusion
Heap-based buffer overflows and heap spraying are critical vulnerabilities that extend beyond stack-based overflows. Heap spraying has been a significant attack vector in browser-based exploits. Understanding the type of state that can be corrupted and the general steps involved in these exploits can assist in formulating effective security measures.
