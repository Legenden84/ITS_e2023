# 3.2 Password-guessing strategies and defenses

## Introduction

The text discusses the complexity and variations in password-guessing attacks, asserting that the term "password guessing" can sometimes cause more confusion than clarity due to the distinctive strategies involved. These strategies are categorized into two main types: Online Password Guessing and Offline Password Guessing. The text also discusses various defensive mechanisms such as rate-limiting, iterated hashing (password stretching), password salting, and the use of pepper (secret salt).

## Online Password Guessing and Rate-limiting

### Description

In an Online Password Guessing attack, an attacker tries to breach a publicly accessible, password-protected server. The attacker, who can be a human or an automated program, is assumed to have one or more valid user IDs. These IDs are often easily obtainable and are used in attempts to guess the correct password.

### Defensive Measures

1. **Rate-limiting**: One countermeasure is to limit the rate of password-guess attempts. By enforcing a maximum number of incorrect login attempts within a given time frame, the server can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

2. **Increasing Delays**: Another tactic is to exponentially increase the system's response time after each successive incorrect login attempt (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, etc.)

3. **Account Recovery Methods**: The downside of rate-limiting is that legitimate users may get locked out. This drawback can be mitigated through account recovery methods, discussed in Section 3.3 of the text.

## Offline Password Guessing

### Description

Offline Password Guessing attacks occur when an attacker gains access to the system's password hash file. Unlike online attacks, thereâ€™s no need to interact with the online server, thus allowing an unlimited number of attempts within a given timeframe, only constrained by the attacker's computational resources.

### Defensive Measures

1. **Iterated Hashing (Password Stretching)**: The text suggests using iterated hashing to make the password hash computationally expensive to calculate. The hashing function is applied multiple times (d times), making it slower for an attacker to compute.

2. **Salting**: Salting is another technique where a random value (the salt) is added to the password before hashing. This effectively prevents the use of precomputed tables in dictionary attacks and makes trawling attacks harder.

3. **Pepper (Secret Salt)**: A more advanced form of salting, the pepper is a secret salt that isn't stored. When a user selects a password, a random value `ri` is chosen and then erased after hashing. During verification, the system iteratively tries all possible `ri` values until a match is found, thus slowing down the attack.

## Additional Concepts

### 1. Password Hashing vs. Reversible Encryption

The text points out that password hashing is more commonly used than reversible encryption. Reversible encryption requires additional means to protect the encryption key itself.

### 2. Salting Variations

Salts can be user-specific or could combine a global system salt, adding an additional layer of security.

### 3. Impact on System Performance

Practical values for iterated hashing (`d`) need to be selected carefully to balance security and system performance.

# Password Security Overview

## Specialized Password-Hashing Functions
- **General crypto hash functions**: Older algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 are too fast, aiding offline guessing attacks.
- **GPU hashing**: Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) accelerate these attacks.
- **Solution**: New algorithms like Argon2, bcrypt, and scrypt are designed to be "GPU-unfriendly."
- **KDFs**: Key Derivation Functions like PBKDF2 create strong keys from passwords.

## System-Assigned Passwords
- **Brute-force guessing**: No better strategy than enumerating through all combinations.
- **Usability**: Difficult for users to remember random strings, hence little used today.

## Probability of Guessing Success
- **Parameters**: G (guesses per time), T (time units), R (password space).
- **Probability formula**: q = GT/R (if GT <= R).

## Password Expiration/Aging
- Policies require regular password changes. Questionable effectiveness.

## User-Chosen Passwords
- **Skewed Distributions**: Users tend to pick easy-to-remember (and guess) passwords.
- **Dictionary attacks**: Target the most popular passwords first.

## Password Denylists
- **Proactive password checking**: Blocks the use of passwords on a denylist.
- **Heuristic password-cracking tools**: Tools like JohnTheRipper and oclHashcat use various techniques for password cracking.

## Login Passwords vs Passkeys
- **Login passwords**: Focus on rate-limiting, denylisting, salting, and iterated hashing.
- **Passkeys**: For encryption, stronger passwords are necessary. Memory aids include passphrases and secure storage.

## Password Management Guidelines
- **NIST SP 800-63B**: U.S. guidelines revised in 2017 include denylists, rate-limiting, and secure storage methods.
