# 3.5 Biometric authentication

## Overview

The text discusses the ins and outs of biometric authentication, contrasting it with traditional methods like passwords and hardware tokens. While biometric methods offer significant usability benefits, they have their own set of challenges and are not as secure as commonly believed. The text delves into different aspects of biometrics such as physical and behavioral characteristics, failure modes, and the process of enrollment and verification.

## Passwords vs Biometrics

- **Passwords**: Known for both usability and security disadvantages.
- **Hardware Tokens**: Score well on security but are cumbersome and expensive.

### Promotion of Biometrics

- **Usability**: No need to carry anything or remember passwords.
- **Speed**: Faster than typing a password.
- **Scalability**: Burden does not increase with multiple accounts.

## Biometric Characteristics

- **Physical Biometrics**: Static physiological characteristics like fingerprints.
- **Behavioral Biometrics**: Features related to behavior, e.g., geolocation patterns.

### Biometric Modality

- A set of features used for biometric authentication.

## Assumptions in Biometric Authentication

- Biometric data is **non-secret**.
- Biometrics rely on **trusted input channels**.
- Not suitable for **remote authentication over the Internet**.

### Failure Modes

- **Failure to Enroll (FTE)**: Difficulty in registering a template.
- **Failure to Capture (FTC)**: Inability to acquire a quality sample.

## Disadvantages of Biometrics

- Requires custom client-side hardware.
- Lack of fallback mechanisms for legitimate users.
- **Security Risk**: Similar to password reuse. Biometric data cannot be changed once compromised.
- **Overstated Security**: Security is often assumed to be higher than it actually is.

## Biometric Process

- **Enrollment**: Features are extracted to build a reference template.
- **Verification**: A freshly taken sample is compared to the stored template.

### Thresholds in Biometrics

- A threshold score (`t`) is set to determine matches.

## Error Types in Biometrics

- **False Reject**: Legitimate user is not recognized.
- **False Accept**: Imposter is recognized as a legitimate user.

### Error Rates

- **False Accept Rate (FAR)**: Probability of a false accept.
- **False Reject Rate (FRR)**: Probability of a false reject.
- **Equal Error Rate (EER)**: Point where FAR equals FRR.

## Evaluating Biometrics

Criteria include:

- **Universality**: Does every user have this characteristic?
- **Distinguishability**: Do features vary enough across users?
- **Invariance**: Stability of features over time.
- **Ease-of-sampling**: How easily can samples be obtained and measured?
- **Accuracy**: Metrics such as FAR, FRR, EER, FTE-rate, FTC-rate.
- **Cost**: Includes time, storage, and hardware/software costs.
- **User Acceptance**: Willingness of users to adopt the system.
- **Attack-resistance**: Ability to resist spoofing and other attacks.

## Circumvention and Attacks

- Main question is how easily a biometric system can be fooled.

### Authentication vs Identification

- **Authentication**: One-to-one matching.
- **Identification**: One-to-many matching, not suitable for systems with large user bases.

## Summary

- Biometrics are not a "silver bullet" solution.
- Suitability depends on the target environment.
- Offers usability advantages but also has deployability disadvantages.
- Generally less secure than commonly believed.
