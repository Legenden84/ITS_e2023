# Detailed Summary of Password Managers and Graphical Passwords

## Introduction
The text provides an exhaustive review of Password Managers and Graphical Password schemes, elaborating on their features, advantages, disadvantages, and security implications. The overarching theme suggests that while these tools aim to improve usability and security, they often fall short in practice and introduce new types of risks.

## Password Managers

### Basic Functionality
Password managers store and retrieve passwords for users, requiring only a single "master password" for access to the entire database of credentials. This is supposed to ease memory burden and increase efficiency.

### Security Advantages
- **Phishing Resistance**: Tool records domain information, providing warnings or blocks against unauthorized domains.
- **Master Passwords**: The emphasis on a single, strong master password can potentially increase security.

### Shortcomings
- **Weak Master Passwords**: Master passwords may not be as strong as desired.
- **Static Site Passwords**: Many individual site passwords remain static and user-chosen, thus being replayable and potentially guessable.
- **Security Risks**: Concentration of all passwords creates a single point of failure.

### Types of Software Packaging
- **Operating System Utility**: Like macOS Keychain.
- **Standalone Client Application**: Independent software.
- **Browser Feature or Plugin**: Integrated within a web browser.
- **Cloud-based Service**: Managed remotely and accessible from multiple devices.

### Approaches

#### Password Wallet (Vault)
- **Functionality**: Manages an existing collection of passwords.
- **Storage**: Encrypted under a master password.
- **Barriers**: Difficulty in migrating to new, strong passwords due to user time investment.
- **Location**: Stored either locally or in the cloud.

#### Derived Passwords
- **Functionality**: Site-specific passwords are generated based on a master password and other parameters like domain.
- **Security Features**: Protection against phishing and guessing through iterated hashing and user-specific salts.

### Security and Risks
- **Threat Vectors**: Master password capture by malware, phishing, network interception, and both offline and online guessing attacks.
- **Increased Attack Surface**: New forms of vulnerability but reduced keylogger susceptibility.

### If Password Manager Fails
- **Consequences**: Loss of access to passwords, catastrophic data loss, especially for local file/disk encryption passwords.

### Compatibility Issues
- **Server Incompatibility**: Mostly non-existent for password wallets.
- **Policy Compatibility**: Automatically generated passwords might not comply with server-defined composition policies.

## Graphical Passwords

### Basic Premise
Graphical passwords use pictures or patterns as the authentication mechanism. The theory is that pictures are easier to remember than text, thus easing the memory burden.

### Classes of Graphical Passwords

1. **Pure Recall**: User reconstructs a pattern.
2. **Cued Recall**: User is aided by a graphical cue.
3. **Recognition Schemes**: User recognizes a previously seen image.

### Analysis

#### Usability
- **Minor Improvements**: Graphical passwords offer only minor memorability improvements, often requiring significant training.

#### Security
- **Predictable Choices**: Users often choose predictable images, making the system insecure.
- **Unsuccessful Displacement**: Text passwords remain more commonly used except on smartphones.

#### Security Risks
- **Replay Attacks**: Simple graphical passwords are just as susceptible to replay attacks as text-based passwords.

### Conclusion
Both password managers and graphical passwords have their merits but also introduce new complexities and risks. Their adoption is generally driven by a desire for increased usability, but the security improvements are often less than ideal.
