# # 8.3 Certificate revocation

## Overview
The text is an in-depth discussion on the subject of Certificate Revocation, specifically how certificates, commonly used in centralized systems, can be invalidated or "revoked" before their predefined expiration date. It elaborates on the responsibilities of the Certificate Authorities (CAs) for managing the revocation, the various reasons for which a certificate might be revoked, and the methods employed to handle and propagate revocation information.

## Sections Breakdown

### 8.3 Certificate Revocation
- **Introduction to Certificate Expiration**: Explains that certificates have a predefined expiration date, typically lasting 1–2 years, but can be revoked prematurely.

- **Role of Certificate Authorities (CAs)**: Specifies that in centralized systems, CAs are responsible for making information about revoked certificates accessible to relying parties. The CA that issued a certificate is recognized as its "revocation authority."

### REVOCATION REASONS
- **Key Compromise**: States that the most severe reason for revoking a public-key certificate is the compromise or suspected compromise of the owner’s private key.

- **Other Reasons**: Lists additional reasons such as superseding keys, discontinuing use of a key, or the certificate owner changing job roles or affiliations.

### Main Approaches for Revoking Certificates
#### METHOD I: CERTIFICATE REVOCATION LISTS (CRLs)
- **Weekly or Frequent Updates**: Explains that a CA periodically issues a signed, dated list of serial numbers of all its revoked but unexpired certificates.

- **Push and Pull Models**: Describes two distribution methods for CRLs—either actively sending the list to community members (push model) or making it available at a certain location for retrieval (pull model).

- **Issues with CRL Length**: Addresses that the length of a CRL could be problematic and suggests that shortening certificate validity periods could mitigate this issue.

#### METHOD II: CRL FRAGMENTS—PARTITIONS AND DELTAS
- **CRL Partitions**: Introduces the concept of breaking down full CRLs into smaller pieces, known as partitioned CRLs, based on serial number ranges or categories of revocation reasons.

- **Delta CRLs**: Discusses how updates to existing CRLs are issued, allowing relying parties to construct full CRLs by accumulating these updates.

- **CRL Aggregator Services**: Suggests that managing delta CRLs may be offloaded to specialized services.

#### METHOD III: ONLINE STATUS CHECKING
- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)**: Details a real-time method where relying parties consult an online server to confirm a certificate's validity.

- **OCSP-Stapling**: Describes a push model variation where certificate holders provide timestamped assertions of their certificate's validity.

#### METHOD IV: SHORT-LIVED CERTIFICATES
- **Avoiding Revocation**: Discusses issuing certificates with very short validity periods to eliminate the need for revocation.

- **Drawbacks**: Notes that the overhead of frequently re-issuing certificates is a drawback.

#### METHOD V: SERVING TRUSTED PUBLIC KEYS DIRECTLY
- **No Certificates**: Discusses the idea of bypassing certificates altogether and serving public keys directly from a trusted server.

- **Trade-offs**: Points out increased load on servers and key management issues as significant trade-offs of this method.

### Additional Concepts
#### REVOKED CERTIFICATES: CA VS. END-ENTITY
- **Different Types of Certificates**: Mentions that both CA and leaf certificates can be revoked and details scenarios involving multiple certificates from multiple CAs.

- **Certification Authority Revocation Lists (CARLs)**: Introduces the concept of CARLs, which are specific to revoked CA certificates.

#### DENIAL OF SERVICE ON REVOCATION
- **Security Concerns**: Discusses the risk of denial-of-service attacks affecting the revocation process.

- **Failing Modes**: Explains that if revocation information is blocked, systems either fail closed (assume the certificate is revoked) or fail open (assume the certificate is valid), the latter of which is problematic.

The text provides a comprehensive view on certificate revocation, examining multiple methods and their trade-offs, the role and responsibilities of CAs, as well as security concerns related to revocation.
