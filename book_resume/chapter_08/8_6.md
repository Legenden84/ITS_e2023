# 8.6 Secure email overview and public-key distribution

The text provides an in-depth overview of secure email and the challenges and solutions surrounding its implementation, particularly in the context of public-key distribution.

## Introduction
The section begins by discussing what end-to-end secure email is: messages are encrypted and digitally signed at the sender's device and then decrypted and verified at the recipient's device. The text outlines the challenges of key management and acquiring trustworthy public keys.

## Historical Technologies
It mentions three technologies crucial in the history of secure email:
- **PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)**: Described as historically significant, it used a one-root PKI hierarchy and was the first comprehensive secure email effort.
- **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**: Caters to highly technical users, ideal for private individuals or small, static groups.
- **S/MIME (Secure MIME)**: Suitable for enterprise users and uses centralized certificate management.

## Email Transport
This subsection dives into the Mail User Agent (MUA) and how it interacts with the Mail Submission Agent (MSA) and Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It describes how recipient's MUA retrieves messages via either IMAP or POP3, discussing their different use-cases. It highlights that secure email must consider whether to store messages in plaintext or encrypted form on servers.

## Message Structure for Regular and Secure Email
The text explains how mail messages are structured, dividing them into envelope and content sections. For secure email, it details the addition of a new interior security header within the content section, which is crucial for security functionalities like signature verification and decryption.

## Secure Email Specifics
The document elaborates on the components and metadata included in the security header of a secure email. It talks about how:
- A symmetric key `k` is used to encrypt the plaintext body.
- The plaintext body is also hashed and digitally signed.
- Multiple fields in the security header provide information necessary for decryption, verification, and identifying algorithms and keys used.

## Public-Key Distribution
This section outlines two primary methods for distributing public keys:
- **Centralized Public-Key Distribution**: Discusses the role of an online trusted public-key server, similar to a Key Distribution Center (KDC), but for distributing public keys.
- **Certificate Directory**: Talks about a repository of CA-signed certificates. It describes that these certificates can be retrieved at any time and don't need to be trusted as the trust comes from the verification of signatures on certificates.

## Pros and Cons of Certificates
The text discusses the benefits and downsides of using certificates. Advantages include easier audits, while disadvantages involve issues like certificate revocation and validation.

## Exercises
It poses two exercises:
1. Discussing what information is exposed to eavesdroppers if the content header is left unencrypted.
2. Comparing the advantages of first computing a digital signature then encrypting it along with the body, versus first encrypting the body and then signing it.

## Additional Context
The section concludes with some miscellaneous points:
- **End-to-end vs. TLS Encryption**: Talks about how common webmail interfaces only use TLS, making them less secure.
- **Content Scanning**: Explains that end-to-end encryption prevents content-based malware and spam detection, presenting a challenge for service providers.

Overall, the text serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the complexities and solutions in implementing secure email, particularly focusing on key management and public-key distribution.
