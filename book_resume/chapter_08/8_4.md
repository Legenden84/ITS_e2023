# CA/PKI architectures and certificate trust models

The text is a comprehensive explanation of Certificate Authority (CA) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) architectures, as well as certificate trust models. It delves deep into the various structures and philosophies that govern how these digital certificate systems operate and how trust is established and managed within them.

## Trust Model Definition
The text begins by defining a certificate trust model as a system comprising design, procedures, and rules. This system is implemented through software and other processes to validate public-key certificates and determine the allowed uses for their public keys.

## Philosophy vs. Technical Ability
The text then differentiates between the philosophy and technical capability of a trust model. It suggests that useful models are those tailored to fulfill specific objectives or application needs, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

## Toolbox for Customization
The text discusses the various data structures like ITU-T:X.500, X.509 certificates, and IETF RFCs that serve as a toolbox. This toolbox allows for customization to suit specific needs, ranging from automotive manufacturers to federal governments and business-to-consumer applications.

## Various Trust Models

### Model I: Single-CA Domains
The first model discussed involves single-CA domains that do not have any trust connections between different communities. It is illustrated as a simple, closed system and is likened to current end-to-end secure instant messaging systems like WhatsApp.

### Model II: Strict Hierarchy
The second model outlines a strict hierarchical CA system with a single root CA at the top, followed by multiple levels of intermediate CAs.

### Model III: Ring-Mesh of Tree Roots
In this model, each single-CA domain evolves into a multi-CA hierarchical tree. These trees are then connected at their roots in various topologies, like pairwise cross-connects or through a bridge CA.

### Model IV: Forest of Hierarchical Trees (Browser Model)
This model employs a list of trust anchors comprising public keys of multiple root CAs. It allows for trust in multiple, disconnected hierarchical trees, and is cited as the approach used in browser trust models.

### Model V: Decentralized CA Trust (Enterprise PKI Model)
This model focuses on bottom-level CAs and allows for a high level of customization and adaptability. It supports complex architectures like complete networks, hierarchies, ring-meshes, and bridge CAs.

### Model VI: User-Control Trust Model (Web of Trust)
The last model discusses a system where there are no formal CAs. Each end-user makes individual trust decisions and effectively acts as their own CA.

## Practical Examples
- The text also includes practical examples to illustrate these models. For instance, it describes how an enterprise company with three divisions in different countries could interconnect their separate CAs.
- Another example details how two subsidiaries of a company could cross-certify their respective hierarchical CA systems to enable specific divisions to communicate securely.

## Bridge CA
The text introduces the concept of a Bridge CA as a hub-and-spoke model designed to reduce complexity in large sets of peers or trading partners.

## Complexity and Scalability
The text also covers how complexity scales with the number of CAs involved. It highlights that as the number of CAs increases, the potential for combinatorial complexity also increases, leading to more intricate trust models.

## Motivations and Practical Considerations
The text closes by discussing the practical motivations for choosing certain models over others. It emphasizes that PKIs are often built in an incremental fashion, beginning perhaps within a department and gradually expanding.

## Conclusion
The section concludes by highlighting two essential aspects that distinguish PKI trust architectures:
1. The trust anchors configured in end-entity software clients.
2. The relationships defined by CA-certificates between different CAs.
