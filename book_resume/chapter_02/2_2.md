# 2.2 Symmetric-key encryption and decryption

## Introduction
The text elaborates on symmetric-key encryption, one of two categories of cryptographic algorithms—the other being asymmetric encryption. In symmetric-key encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The text introduces various types of symmetric ciphers, including stream ciphers and block ciphers, and explores their properties, limitations, and common modes of operation.

## Symmetric-Key Encryption
Symmetric-key encryption uses the same key for both the encryption and decryption processes. This is mathematically represented by `k = k0` in equation (2.1).

### Example: Vernam Cipher
- **Concept**: The Vernam cipher is a stream cipher that encrypts plaintext one bit at a time.
- **Key Requirement**: It requires a key that is as long as the plaintext.
- **Algorithm**: Encryption and decryption are performed using bitwise exclusive-OR (XOR) operations.
- **One-Time Pad**: If the key is randomly chosen and never reused, this cipher is known as a one-time pad, which offers theoretically unbreakable encryption.

#### Proof Sketch for Unbreakability of One-Time Pad
Any given ciphertext could originate from any possible plaintext when a unique key is used for each encryption, making it impossible for an attacker to determine the original message.

### Limitations of One-Time Pads
- **Key Management**: Difficult to distribute and manage keys that are as long as the message.
- **Lack of Integrity**: Encryption alone does not guarantee the integrity of the data, as demonstrated by a theoretical scenario involving salary manipulation.

## Cipher Attacks in Practice
- **Types of Security**: One-time pad offers information-theoretic security, while most ciphers offer only computational security.
- **Weaknesses**: Ciphers can fail due to algorithmic flaws, small key spaces, or keys being compromised.

## Types of Symmetric Ciphers

### Vernam Cipher (A Type of Stream Cipher)

#### Overview
- A Vernam cipher is a primitive but important example of a stream cipher.

#### Key Length
- It requires a key that is as long as the plaintext message. If the plaintext message has `t` bits, the key also needs to have `t` bits.

#### Algorithmic Details
- It employs bitwise exclusive-OR (XOR) operations for both encryption and decryption.
  - **Encryption**: `ci = mi ⊕ ki` where `ci` is the `i-th` bit of the ciphertext, `mi` is the `i-th` bit of the plaintext, and `ki` is the `i-th` bit of the key.
  - **Decryption**: `mi = ci ⊕ ki`, which reverses the encryption operation.

#### Special Case: One-Time Pad
- When a randomly generated key is used only once, the Vernam cipher is also known as a one-time pad.

#### Security Strengths
- The one-time pad version is considered theoretically unbreakable. Every ciphertext can be decrypted to any plaintext given the appropriate key, making it impervious to attacks.

#### Practical Limitations
- One-time pads, while theoretically secure, are rarely used due to the difficulty in managing long, single-use keys.
- If a secure method exists to transfer a key as long as the message, that method could also be used to securely transfer the message itself, negating the need for encryption.

#### Integrity Issues
- The text stresses that despite being theoretically secure, the Vernam cipher doesn't guarantee data integrity, offering an example involving tampering with a salary value to illustrate the point.

### AES Block Cipher

#### Introduction and Origin
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the most widely adopted block cipher today.
- It was developed by researchers at Flemish university KU Leuven and standardized by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

#### Core Mechanism
- Operates on fixed-size blocks of data, commonly 128 bits in the case of AES.
- Encrypts each block with a transformation dependent on the key.

#### Padding Mechanism
- Requires padding for the last plaintext block if it doesn't fit the block size. A common rule is to pad a 1-bit followed by as many 0-bits as needed.

#### Security Levels
- AES is considered computationally secure against attackers with limited computational resources.

#### Example: AES Block Cipher
- **Popular Algorithm**: Most widely used block cipher today.
- **Creation**: Created by KU Leuven researchers and standardized by NIST.

## Message Expansion
Symmetric ciphers are generally length-preserving but may require additional space for authentication tags or other parameters for integrity protection.

## Modes of Operation for Block Ciphers

### Electronic Code Book (ECB) Mode

#### Description and Mechanics
- ECB mode encrypts each block of plaintext independently, using the same key.

#### Security Limitations
- ECB mode is vulnerable to pattern analysis. If two identical blocks of plaintext are encrypted with the same key, the resulting ciphertext blocks will also be identical, revealing data patterns.

### Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode

#### Description and Mechanics
- In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted.

#### Security Strengths
- This method disrupts patterns in the ciphertext, making it more secure than ECB.

#### Performance Drawbacks
- CBC encryption cannot be parallelized because each block depends on the previous block.

### Counter (CTR) Mode

#### Description and Mechanics
- CTR mode encrypts counters (usually sequential integers) using the block cipher, and then XORs these encrypted counters with the plaintext blocks to produce the ciphertext.

#### Security Strengths and Use-cases
- CTR is recommended for applications that require encrypting data in real-time or in a parallelized fashion.


## Encryption in Practice
- Symmetric-key encryption is usually combined with integrity mechanisms like Message Authentication Codes (MACs).
