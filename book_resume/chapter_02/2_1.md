# 2.1 Encryption and decryption (generic concepts)

## Overview

Section 2.1 extensively discusses the generic concepts underpinning encryption and decryption, which are central to data confidentiality in distributed communications systems. It breaks down complex elements such as encryption algorithms, keys, and types of attacks into comprehensible terminology.

## Basic Definitions

### Algorithm
An algorithm is a series of steps or procedures, often implemented in software or hardware, for accomplishing a specific task.

### Plaintext and Ciphertext
- **Plaintext**: The original readable data.
- **Ciphertext**: The unreadable output after applying encryption.

### Cryptographic Key
A cryptographic key, usually represented as a binary string, is a large, secret number that parameterizes the encryption and decryption algorithms.

## Transformation Process

The encryption algorithm transforms plaintext into ciphertext. This process is reversible using a decryption key and the corresponding decryption algorithm. Only authorized parties with access to this decryption key can revert the ciphertext back to plaintext.

## Generic Encryption Notation

- **Plaintext (m)**: Original message
- **Ciphertext (c)**: Encrypted message
- **Encryption Algorithm (Ek)** and **Decryption Algorithm (Dk')**: Both parameterized by symmetric keys `k` and `k'`.
  - Encryption: $c = E_k(m)$
  - Decryption: $m = D_{k'}(c)$

## Exercise: Caesar Cipher

This is a simplistic cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted three places down the alphabet. The exercise prompts the reader to describe the encryption (E) and decryption (D) algorithms mathematically, to identify the cryptographic key, and to discuss other potential keys.

## Mathematical Terminology

In mathematical terms, an encryption-decryption system, or cryptosystem, can be described with sets `P` (plaintexts), `C` (ciphertexts), and `K` (keys), along with encryption mapping \( E: (P \times K) \to C \) and decryption mapping \( D: (C \times K) \to P \).

## Exhaustive Key Search

This is a brute-force technique where an attacker tries to decrypt a ciphertext by trying all possible keys from the key space `K`. If the algorithm has no weaknesses, then the entire key space must be tried. The section illustrates the enormity of this task through a discussion about 128-bit keys.

## Example: DES Key Space

DES (Data Encryption Standard) was standardized in 1977 with a key length of 56 bits. The section provides a vivid metaphor to understand the impracticality of exhaustive key search in DES.

## Cipher Attack Models

1. **Ciphertext-only Attack**: The attacker has access only to the ciphertext.
2. **Known-plaintext Attack**: The attacker knows some ciphertext and the corresponding plaintext.
3. **Chosen-plaintext Attack**: The attacker can choose plaintext and see the resulting ciphertext.
4. **Chosen-ciphertext Attack**: The attacker provides ciphertext and receives back the corresponding plaintext.

An ideal encryption algorithm should resist all these types of attacks.

## Passive vs. Active Adversary

- **Passive Adversary**: Merely observes and records, involved in ciphertext-only or known-plaintext attacks.
- **Active Adversary**: Alters or injects data, initiates new interactions, and may be involved in chosen-plaintext or chosen-ciphertext attacks.

## Summary

Section 2.1 is a comprehensive examination of encryption and decryption, covering fundamental concepts, mathematical formalisms, types of attacks, and practical concerns. It demystifies complex topics, rendering them accessible for application in secure communications.
