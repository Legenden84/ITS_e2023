# 2.1 Encryption and decryption (generic concepts)

## Overview

Section 2.1 extensively discusses the generic concepts underpinning encryption and decryption, which are central to data confidentiality in distributed communications systems. It breaks down complex elements such as encryption algorithms, keys, and types of attacks into comprehensible terminology.

## Basic Definitions

### Algorithm
An algorithm is a series of steps or procedures, often implemented in software or hardware, for accomplishing a specific task.

### Plaintext and Ciphertext
- **Plaintext**: The original readable data.
- **Ciphertext**: The unreadable output after applying encryption.

### Cryptographic Key
A cryptographic key, usually represented as a binary string, is a large, secret number that parameterizes the encryption and decryption algorithms.

## Transformation Process

The encryption algorithm transforms plaintext into ciphertext. This process is reversible using a decryption key and the corresponding decryption algorithm. Only authorized parties with access to this decryption key can revert the ciphertext back to plaintext.

## Generic Encryption Notation

- **Plaintext (m)**: Original message
- **Ciphertext (c)**: Encrypted message
- **Encryption Algorithm (Ek)** and **Decryption Algorithm (Dk')**: Both parameterized by symmetric keys `k` and `k'`.
  - Encryption: \( c = E_k(m) \)
  - Decryption: \( m = D_{k'}(c) \)

## Exercise: Caesar Cipher

This is a simplistic cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted three places down the alphabet. The exercise prompts the reader to describe the encryption (E) and decryption (D) algorithms mathematically, to identify the cryptographic key, and to discuss other potential keys.

## Mathematical Terminology

In mathematical terms, an encryption-decryption system, or cryptosystem, can be described with sets `P` (plaintexts), `C` (ciphertexts), and `K` (keys), along with encryption mapping \( E: (P \times K) \to C \) and decryption mapping \( D: (C \times K) \to P \).

## EXHAUSTIVE KEY SEARCH

### Definition and Mechanism
The text introduces "Exhaustive Key Search" as a method employed by an adversary to decrypt a ciphertext when they do not have access to the cryptographic key (`k'`). In this approach, the attacker tries every possible key from the entire set of keys (`K`) to decode the intercepted ciphertext (`c`). For each key `k` in the key space `K`, the attacker applies the decryption algorithm `D`, parameterized by that specific key, on the ciphertext. The result of each decryption `Dk(c)` is then examined to see if it yields the original plaintext message (`m`).

### Computational Complexity
The text underscores the computational intensity and time-consuming nature of this technique. It highlights that unless there are algorithmic vulnerabilities, an exhaustive key search requires the attacker to go through every possible key in the key space.

### Luck Factor
It introduces the concept of 'average luck,' stating that an attacker would typically find the correct key after trying approximately half of all keys in the space. This is not guaranteed but is expected statistically.

### Bit-Length and Number of Trials
The text gives an example, noting that if keys are represented as binary strings of 128 bits, then the key space would contain 2^128 keys. Accordingly, an attacker with average luck would find the correct key after approximately 2^127 trials.

### Human Time Scale
It adds a dramatic flair to the magnitude of these numbers by asserting that the computational requirements are so astronomical that all of humanity would be long dead before an exhaustive key search could successfully recover a 128-bit key.

## Example: DES Key Space

DES (Data Encryption Standard) was standardized in 1977 with a key length of 56 bits. The section provides a vivid metaphor to understand the impracticality of exhaustive key search in DES.

## Cipher Attack Models

1. **Ciphertext-only Attack**: The attacker has access only to the ciphertext.
2. **Known-plaintext Attack**: The attacker knows some ciphertext and the corresponding plaintext.
3. **Chosen-plaintext Attack**: The attacker can choose plaintext and see the resulting ciphertext.
4. **Chosen-ciphertext Attack**: The attacker provides ciphertext and receives back the corresponding plaintext.

An ideal encryption algorithm should resist all these types of attacks.

## Passive vs. Active Adversary

- **Passive Adversary**: Merely observes and records, involved in ciphertext-only or known-plaintext attacks.
- **Active Adversary**: Alters or injects data, initiates new interactions, and may be involved in chosen-plaintext or chosen-ciphertext attacks.

## Summary

Section 2.1 is a comprehensive examination of encryption and decryption, covering fundamental concepts, mathematical formalisms, types of attacks, and practical concerns. It demystifies complex topics, rendering them accessible for application in secure communications.
