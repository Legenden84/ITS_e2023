# 2.5 Cryptographic hash functions

## Introduction

The section discusses the significance, properties, and applications of cryptographic hash functions in security protocols. Cryptographic hash functions accept any binary string as input and produce a fixed-length hash value, which serves as a compact representation of the original data.

### Definition

The term "hash function" in this context exclusively refers to cryptographic hash functions. These hash functions are computationally efficient and create a unique hash value associated with a unique input. Altering even a single bit in the input will lead to a dramatically different hash value, making the function highly sensitive to input changes.

## Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions

Cryptographic hash functions are denoted by `H`, and it is assumed that their algorithmic details are publicly known. Three core security properties are crucial:

- **H1 (Preimage Resistance)**: It should be computationally infeasible to retrieve the original input given its hash.

- **H2 (Second-Preimage Resistance)**: For a given input `m1`, it should be infeasible to find a distinct `m2` such that `H(m1) = H(m2)`.

- **H3 (Collision Resistance)**: It should be computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs that hash to the same value.

These properties may be essential to varying degrees depending on the application.

## Computational Security

The term "infeasible" is used in the context of practical computational limits. Even though multiple inputs can map to a single hash output, finding these inputs should be computationally challenging.

## Design Philosophy

Creating hash functions with properties H1-H3 is a highly specialized art. Security developers are advised to follow the guidance of cryptographic experts in selecting appropriate hash functions.

## Classification of Hash Functions

### One-Way Hash Functions

Used where the property of "one-wayness" is vital, such as in password hashing. Typically, functions with property H1 also offer H2.

### Collision-Resistant Hash Functions

Critical in applications where it must be difficult to find two inputs resulting in the same hash. Notably, H3 implies H2, but not vice versa.

## Applications and Examples

1. **File Integrity Checks**: Hash functions with properties H1-H3 can be used to ensure the integrity of executable files. A trusted hash is stored and compared against the recomputed hash before execution.

2. **Password Verification**: Hash functions are used to store hashed passwords instead of plaintext, providing an additional security layer.

3. **Digital Signatures**: Hash functions are integral in digital signature schemes. A hash of the message is created and signed, requiring a collision-resistant hash function (H3).

## Exercises and Additional Points

- **CRC vs. Cryptographic Hash**: The text prompts the reader to differentiate why CRC algorithms are not suitable for cryptographic hashing.

- **Hash Function Properties**: Exercises explore the necessity of different hash properties in various use-cases, including file integrity and digital signatures.

- **Client-Side Hashing**: An exercise discusses the merits and demerits of hashing passwords at the client side before sending them to the server.

- **Hash Examples**: Common hash functions like SHA-3, SHA-2, SHA-1, and MD5 are mentioned, with a note on the superiority of the more recent algorithms.

- **Birthday Paradox**: Explains how attackers can find collisions more efficiently than expected due to the surprising statistics of the birthday paradox.
