# 2.8 Certificates, elliptic curves, and equivalent keylengths

## Section 2.8 Overview

This section delves into the essential components of cryptography involving public-key certificates, the role of Certification Authorities (CAs), certificate revocation mechanisms, and the influence of key lengths. It also touches upon elliptic curve cryptography as an alternative to traditional methods.

## Certificates

### Definition and Components

- A public-key certificate is a data structure containing:
  1. **Subject Name**: The name of the entity the certificate represents.
  2. **Public Key**: Asserted to belong to the subject.
  3. **Digital Signature**: Made by a third-party, known as a Certification Authority (CA), that validates the binding between the subject and the public key.

### Purpose and Usage

- Certificates aim to bind a subject's identity with their public key reliably.
- Parties that rely on the certificate need to have an authentic copy of the CA’s public key to verify the CA’s signature and therefore the certificate's integrity.

## Certification Authorities (CAs)

### Role and Responsibilities

- The CA's role is vital for generating trustworthy certificates.
- Before signing a certificate, the CA is expected to perform due diligence to verify:
  1. The identity of the subject.
  2. The subject's association with the public key.

### Trust Propagation

- Trust in one key extends to many keys, as the CA's signature on a certificate extends trust to that certificate's public key.

## Certificate Revocation

### Components for Revocation

- Certificates contain additional fields like:
  1. Serial Number: To uniquely identify the certificate.
  2. Expiry Date: Indicating its valid duration.
  3. Revocation Information: Details on how to check if the certificate has been revoked.

### Why and How

- Revocation can happen before the expiry date for various reasons such as a compromised private key or change in the subject’s role.
- Revocation information helps relying parties check the current status of a certificate's validity.

## NIST-Recommended Key Lengths

### Security Strength

- As of November 2015, NIST recommended at least 112 bits of "security strength" for public U.S. government use.
- "Strength" is not just the raw bitlength but an estimate of security based on the best-known attacks.

### Comparisons Between Algorithms

- Key lengths need to be comparable in strength when multiple algorithms are used together to avoid weak links.

## Elliptic Curve Public-Key Systems (ECC)

### Definition and Classification

- ECC is an alternative to integer factorization cryptography (IFC) like RSA, and finite field cryptography (FFC) like Diffie-Hellman.
- ECC involves operations over sets defined by points on an elliptic curve.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**:
  1. Computational efficiency.
  2. Storage efficiency due to smaller key sizes.
- **Disadvantages**:
  1. More complex mathematics.
  2. Signature verification is more computationally intensive than in RSA.

Table 2.3: Recommended keylengths for comparable algorithm strengths. Numbers denote parameter bitlengths. A symmetric key of 128 bits corresponds to the lowest of three
keylengths supported by AES. For RSA and DH, the modulus implies the size of the
public key. RSA entries are for encryption, signatures, and key agreement/key transport
(Chapter 4). These are recommended pairings, rather than exact security equivalents.
