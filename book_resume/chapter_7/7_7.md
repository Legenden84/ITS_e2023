# 7.7 Ransomware, botnets and other beasts

The text is an elaborate overview of various forms of malware, focusing particularly on ransomware, botnets, and other similar threats. It is structured in a highly detailed and technical manner, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

#### Ransomware

1. **Definition and Mechanism**: Describes ransomware as a type of malware that extorts users. It details how ransomware infects a host device and communicates with a remote computer under the control of the attacker.

2. **Types of Ransomware**: Explains two major types.
    - **Encrypting Ransomware**: Prevents file access by encrypting user files and demanding a ransom for the decryption key.
    - **Non-Encrypting Ransomware**: Makes files unavailable through access controls or threatens to delete them.

3. **Payment Forms**: Explains that payments are usually required in hard-to-trace methods like digital currencies. Notes that the rise of Bitcoin has paralleled an increase in ransomware attacks.

4. **Defense**: Advocates regular data backup as the best practice against ransomware attacks.

5. **Asymmetric File Locking**: Discusses the technique of using public-key cryptography in ransomware. Details the cryptographic process involved, including the use of symmetric and asymmetric encryption keys.

6. **Examples and Exercises**: Provides exercises asking for a summary of major ransomware incidents like Gpcode, CryptoLocker, CryptoWall, and Locky. Also provides an example of WannaCry ransomware's technical details.

#### Botnets

1. **Definition**: Defines a botnet as a network of compromised devices controlled remotely. Compromised computers are termed either 'bots' or 'zombies'.

2. **Purpose**: Describes botnets' role in cybercrime including spreading malware, executing DDoS attacks, and generating revenue through spam and keylogging.

3. **Botnet Communication**: Explains that early botnets used centralized communication structures like IRC channels. Discusses the evolution to more resilient, peer-to-peer communication structures.

4. **Examples and Exercises**: Offers exercises that delve into the technical details of specific botnets like Torpig, Zeus, Storm, Conficker, Koobface, BredoLab, and ZeroAccess.

#### Other Malware Forms

1. **Zero-Day Exploits**: Defines and explains the impact of zero-day exploits, which exploit unknown vulnerabilities in software.

2. **Logic Bombs**: Describes logic bombs as code sequences that execute malicious actions under specific conditions. Could be date-based or event-based.

3. **Rabbits**: Introduces the term 'rabbit' to describe a type of virus that replicates rapidly to consume system resources.

4. **Easter Eggs**: Describes Easter eggs as hidden but harmless features in software. Provides an exercise asking to look up the origin of the term and give historical examples.

## Overall

The text serves as an in-depth educational resource, offering both fundamental explanations and technical specifics. Exercises at the end of each section provide further opportunities for engagement and understanding.
