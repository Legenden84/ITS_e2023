# 7.1 Defining malware

This section sets the foundation by offering a formal definition of malware (malicious software). The text defines malware as software that's been intentionally designed or deployed to work against the interests of one or more users, system owners, or administrators. These adverse effects can involve harm to resources, devices, data, software, hardware, or even privacy.

The text makes a distinction between malware and harmful software. The latter includes software that may cause damage unintentionally due to design or implementation flaws. While harmful software is a concern in the domains of dependable and secure computing, the primary focus of this text is on malware.

The text further elaborates that most users, if aware of the software's malicious intent or possible consequences, would opt not to run the software. Malware operates without the explicit approval of an "all-knowing, benign" user.

# Subsection: Questions Regarding Malware

The section begins by posing some guiding questions that help frame the subsequent discussion in the chapter.

## 1. Malware Installation Methods

This question asks how malware gets installed on devices. Multiple avenues are explored:

- Through websites via phishing emails, search engine results, or web ads.
- Downloaded executables that may have been bundled with malware.
- Exploitation of browser vulnerabilities through drive-by downloads and malicious active web content.
- Worms exploiting network services.
- Viruses sent through email attachments.
- Source code repositories where malware may be embedded.
- Firmware and hardware, where the supply chain controls may be compromised.

## 2. Malware Detection Challenges

The section discusses why detecting malware is a complicated task. Several points are covered:

- Context-based nature of malware: SSH server software could be considered malware if installed maliciously.
- Malware identification as an undecidable problem.
- The variable nature of public opinion on what counts as malware, such as ad-generating programs.
- Design of malware to be difficult to detect and reverse-engineer.

## 3. Prevention of Malware Installation

The section delves into methods to prevent malware:

- Limiting the types of software users can install, though it is unpopular and inconvenient.
- User education is brought up but mentioned as being costly, difficult, and often insufficient.
- Code-signing architectures, antivirus tools, and intrusion detection systems as partial solutions.
- In extreme cases, re-installing the entire OS and applications might be necessary.

# Subsection: Software Churn and Malware

This part explores how the ease of software installation and updates in modern systems has not only facilitated technological advancement but also the proliferation of malware. The text discusses:

- Contrast between past and present in software installation methods.
- How users are often tricked into installing software that misrepresents its functionality.
- The high "churn rate" of software on both network infrastructure and end-user devices.
- The ongoing evolution of defenses that almost keeps pace with evolving threats.

The text notes that these challenges are intensified due to a lack of reliable signals for users to identify the source and trustworthiness of downloaded software.
