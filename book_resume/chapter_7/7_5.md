# 7.5 Rootkit detail: installation, object modification, hijacking

The text is a comprehensive technical exposition that discusses different aspects of rootkits, focusing on their installation, the techniques they use to manipulate objects, and how they hijack system calls.

## Hijacking System Calls

1. **User-Mode Programs & Kernel Memory**: Initially, the text lays down the foundational understanding that user-mode programs can't access the kernel memory directly. Instead, they must make system calls.

2. **System Calls & Service Address Table**: System calls are often made through Operating System (OS) services and shared libraries. These calls are mapped to actual kernel functions via a service address table, sometimes called a dispatch table.

3. **Methods of Hijacking**: The text discusses various methods rootkits employ to hijack system calls:
  - **Dispatch Tables**: Altering entries in dispatch tables to redirect calls to rootkit code.
  - **Overwriting Code**: Overwriting the actual code implementing targeted system calls.
  - **Substitute Tables**: Replacing an entire table by changing the address used to find it.

4. **Hooking**: The technique of intercepting calls and redirecting them is termed as 'hooking'. The new code that handles the redirected system call is called a 'hook'.

5. **Legitimate Uses**: It notes that hooking also has legitimate applications, such as in anti-virus software.

## Windows Function Hooking

1. **SSDT and IAT**: Focuses on how Windows systems commonly use System Service Dispatch Table (SSDT) and Import Address Table (IAT) for function pointers in kernel and user space.

2. **Documentation Differences**: Notes that syscall interfaces are not as openly documented in Windows as they are in Unix.

## Inline Hooking

1. **Detour Patching**: An alternative to hijacking dispatch tables through a method called inline hooking which involves detour patching using detour and trampoline functions.

2. **Detection**: Inline hooking can be detected through an integrity check of the target function.

## Kernel Object Modification

1. **Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM)**: Rootkits may hide their processes by directly altering kernel data structures, such as changing the User ID (UID) of a process to zero.

2. **Post-Processing Results**: Rootkits may also modify the results of system calls, effectively pruning out any evidence of their existence.

## Installation Methods

1. **Kernel Module**: Installation through standard kernel module mechanisms, possibly using social engineering.
2. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Using exploits like buffer overflows in kernel code.
3. **Boot Process**: Modifying the boot process to alter the kernel.
4. **Swapped Memory**: Altering kernel memory paged to disk.
5. **DMA**: Using Direct Memory Access to modify kernel memory.

## Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs)

Explains that LKMs are commonly used to install rootkits and how they function.

## Review Section

Gives an overview of the linking and loading process, explaining how executables and shared libraries are created and loaded into memory.

## Exercises

1. **Modular vs. Monolithic Kernel**: Discusses kernel modularity and its impact on rootkit installation.
2. **User-Mode Rootkits**: Introduces the concept of user-mode rootkits that operate in the user space.
3. **Keyjacking**: Discusses how DLL injection can pose threats to private keys.
4. **Protecting Local Data**: Mentions the importance of encrypting local data to counter the risks posed by client-side malware.

## Questions and Exercises

1. **User Mode Rootkit Detection**: Proposes a question on detecting user mode rootkits.
2. **Encrypting Data in RAM**: Discusses issues related to storing sensitive data like passwords in RAM.
3. **Hardware Storage for Secrets**: Talks about using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for better security and poses a question regarding its effectiveness.

The text is rich with technical information, aimed at providing an in-depth understanding of how rootkits function and how they can be detected or mitigated.
