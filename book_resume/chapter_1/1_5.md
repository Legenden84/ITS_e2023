# Detailed Summary: Threat Modeling: Diagrams, Trees, Lists and STRIDE (Section 1.5)

## Introduction
Section 1.5 of the text elaborates on threat modeling, a framework used to identify vulnerabilities, threats, and threat agents that could compromise a target system. This technique incorporates adversary modeling and makes assumptions about the target system and its environment. The text discusses various approaches to threat modeling, including diagram-driven models, attack trees, checklists, and the STRIDE methodology.

## Diagram-Driven Threat Modeling (1.5.1)

### Overview
Diagram-driven threat modeling initiates with an architectural representation of the target system. This involves sketching out the system components and the data flow between them, highlighting system gateways and trust domains.

### Steps and Considerations

1. **Trust Domains**: Identify zones with specific trust assumptions, such as authenticated areas or zones behind firewalls.
2. **Component Analysis**: Focus on each component and ask, "Where can bad things happen? How?"
3. **Data Flow**: Trace the flow of data for simple to complex tasks.
4. **User Workflow**: Examine how user actions evolve from the start to the end of a task.
5. **Sensitive Data**: Locate and mark where sensitive data files are stored.
6. **Authorized Access**: Ensure all authorized access paths are shown.
7. **Non-Standard Paths**: Check for other potential access points like backups and cloud storage.
8. **Communication Paths**: Consider all possible communication paths, including wireless and VPN.

### Iterative Refinement
The diagram is meant to be a live document, continually revisited and refined. The goal is to stimulate free thought about possible threats beyond staring at a blank page.

## Attack Trees for Threat Modeling (1.5.2)

### Overview
Attack trees provide a hierarchical view of all possible attack vectors on a system.

### Structure
1. **Root Node**: Specifies the overall attack goal.
2. **Lower Nodes**: Break out alternative methods to achieve the parent goal.
3. **Leaf Nodes**: Terminate the paths of a particular attack vector.
4. **Annotations**: Nodes can be detailed with infeasibility or cost metrics.

### Utility
Attack trees serve multiple functions:
1. **Directed Brainstorming**: Encourages structured thinking.
2. **Policy Formation**: Helps in shaping a security policy.
3. **Security Analysis**: Confirms mechanisms to counter identified attack vectors.
4. **Prioritization**: Can help rank attack vectors based on feasibility and impact.

## Other Threat Modeling Approaches (1.5.3)

### Attack/Threat Checklists
Checklists offer a structured approach to threat identification based on past experience. They are both comprehensive and may require less experience to use.

#### Pros and Cons
- **Pros**: Extensive, well-known threats are not overlooked.
- **Cons**: May overlook unique threats to specific systems; could be tedious and distracting.

### STRIDE Methodology

STRIDE is an acronym that aids memory recall for the following six categories of threats:

1. **Spoofing**: Impersonation attacks.
2. **Tampering**: Unauthorized alteration of data or code.
3. **Repudiation**: Denial of actions.
4. **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized data leaks.
5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Disruption of services.
6. **Escalation of Privileges**: Gaining unauthorized access levels.

STRIDE adds value by guiding thought during diagram analysis. Each category prompts you to think critically about possible vulnerabilities at various points in the system architecture.

## Conclusion
Threat modeling is an invaluable tool in cybersecurity that can adopt various forms, each with its unique advantages and limitations. Diagram-driven threat modeling helps create a tangible view of the system, attack trees provide a hierarchical understanding of attack vectors, checklists ensure that common vulnerabilities are not overlooked, and STRIDE offers a categorized approach to identifying potential issues. Employing a combination of these methods could result in a robust threat model.
