# 1.7 Design principles for computer security

## Introduction
The text discusses the complex nature of designing secure computer-based systems. There's no one-size-fits-all checklist to ensure security due to the varying technologies, environments, applications, and requirements. System designers are advised to follow general security design principles, which are outlined and revisited throughout the document.

## Core Principles

### P1: Simplicity and Necessity
- **Goal**: Keep designs simple and minimalistic.
- **Approach**:
  - Minimize the number of components.
  - Disable non-essential services and applications by default.
- **Why Important**:
  - Easier to analyze.
  - Reduced likelihood of errors and oversights.
- **Related Concepts**:
  - Minimizing the attack surface.

### P2: Safe Defaults
- **Goal**: Use secure default settings.
- **Approach**:
  - Use deny-by-default for access control.
  - Use allowlists over denylists.
- **Why Important**:
  - Many users never change default settings.
- **Related Concepts**:
  - Opportunistic encryption for data in transit.

### P3: Open Design
- **Goal**: Do not rely on obscurity.
- **Approach**:
  - Use public, scrutinized algorithms and designs.
- **Why Important**:
  - Security through obscurity is not sustainable.
- **Related Concepts**:
  - Kerckhoffs' principle.

### P4: Complete Mediation
- **Goal**: Verify authorization for every object access.
- **Approach**:
  - Authenticate identity.
  - Check authorization and integrity.
- **Why Important**:
  - Ensures only authorized entities gain access.

### P5: Isolated Compartments
- **Goal**: Use strong isolation structures.
- **Approach**:
  - Use containment means like firewalls, virtualization, etc.
- **Why Important**:
  - Limits damage from security breaches.

### P6: Least Privilege
- **Goal**: Limit privileges to the minimum necessary.
- **Approach**:
  - Allocate only necessary permissions and for limited time.
- **Why Important**:
  - Reduces exposure and limits damage.

### P7: Modular Design
- **Goal**: Design systems to be modular.
- **Approach**:
  - Use object-oriented design to segregate privileges.
- **Why Important**:
  - Makes system more robust and easier to manage.

### P8: Small Trusted Bases
- **Goal**: Limit code size for critical components.
- **Approach**:
  - Keep codebase small for components that are crucial for security.
- **Why Important**:
  - Easier to analyze and less likely to have vulnerabilities.

### P9: Time-tested Tools
- **Goal**: Use tried and true security tools.
- **Approach**:
  - Prefer well-known, heavily scrutinized mechanisms.
- **Why Important**:
  - Historically more reliable.

### P10: Least Surprise
- **Goal**: Design with the user's expectations in mind.
- **Approach**:
  - Make security mechanisms intuitive and easy to use.
- **Why Important**:
  - Reduces user-induced security errors.

### P11: User Buy-in
- **Goal**: Design mechanisms that users will actually use.
- **Approach**:
  - Minimize inconvenience and highlight benefits.
- **Why Important**:
  - Increases compliance and effectiveness.

### P12: Sufficient Work Factor
- **Goal**: Make attacks too costly for the attacker.
- **Approach**:
  - Use strong defenses and cryptographic keys.
- **Why Important**:
  - Makes attacks impractical.

### P13: Defense in Depth
- **Goal**: Use layered defenses.
- **Approach**:
  - Employ multiple independent layers of security.
- **Why Important**:
  - No single point of failure.

### P14: Evidence Production
- **Goal**: Keep records for accountability.
- **Approach**:
  - Use logs and monitoring tools.
- **Why Important**:
  - Supports forensic analysis and intrusion detection.

### P15: Datatype Validation
- **Goal**: Validate all received data.
- **Approach**:
  - Ensure received data meets expected properties.
- **Why Important**:
  - Protects against code injection attacks.

### P16: Remnant Removal
- **Goal**: Remove sensitive data after session termination.
- **Approach**:
  - Securely delete all sensitive data from storage and memory.
- **Why Important**:
  - Prevents data leakage.

### P17: Trust Anchor Justification
- **Goal**: Justify points of assumed trust.
- **Approach**:
  - Verify trust assumptions.
- **Why Important**:
  - Foundation for extending trust in a system.

### P18: Independent Confirmation
- **Goal**: Use independent checks for code or data integrity.
- **Approach**:
  - Confirm data integrity through an independent channel.
- **Why Important**:
  - Increases confidence in system security.

## Summary

Designing a secure system is a complex task requiring a multi-faceted approach. However, following these well-established principles makes the task manageable and considerably less prone to error. From simplicity and isolation to user experience and validation, these principles are pivotal in achieving robust computer security.
