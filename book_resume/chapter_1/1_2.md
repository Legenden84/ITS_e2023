# Detailed Summary of Section 1.2: Computer Security Policies and Attacks

## Introduction

Section 1.2 emphasizes the importance of precise definitions and terminologies in computer security, stating that ambiguity is the enemy of security. The section goes into depth about the core concepts of assets, policies, attacks, agents, threats, and controls in the domain of computer security.

## Asset and Policy

### Assets

- **Definition**: The resources that computer security aims to protect, such as information, software, hardware, and communication services.
- **Physical-world Influence**: Control over financial assets, property, and critical infrastructure can also be considered as assets.

### Security Policies

- **Role**: Provide formal definitions and guidelines for what is and isn't allowed.
- **Content**: Specifies the assets to be protected, users who are authorized, means of access, security services, and system controls.
- **Theory vs. Practice**: Ideally, policies are formal documents; however, in practice, they often become informal guidelines.

## Theoretical and Practical Aspects of Security Policies

### Theoretical Perspective

- **State Classification**: Policies define each possible system state as either secure (authorized) or non-secure (unauthorized).
- **System Actions**: Activities like data transfer, input/output, etc., that cause state transitions.

### Practical Perspective

- **Informality**: Often, security policies are less formal and more focused on guidelines and expectations.
- **Complexity**: Crafting precise policies is difficult and often undervalued until a security breach occurs.

## Attacks and Agents

### Attacks

- **Definition**: Deliberate actions aimed at causing a security policy violation.
- **Exploits**: Attacks leverage vulnerabilities in the system, such as design flaws or poor configurations.

### Agents

- **Adversary**: The entity behind a potential attack.
- **Attacker**: An adversary becomes an attacker once they activate the threat into an actual attack.

## Threats

- **Definition**: A combination of circumstances and entities that might harm assets or violate security.
- **Credibility**: Depends on both the capability and the intention of the threat agent.
- **Mitigation**: The focus is on identifying and eliminating vulnerabilities, thereby nullifying viable attack vectors.

## Types of Attacks

- **Objectives**: Vary from extracting sensitive information to disrupting data integrity, or denial of service.
- **Question Raised**: It compels us to ask - secure against whom and from what types of attacks?

## Controls and Countermeasures

- **Role**: To support and enforce security policies.
- **Types**:
  - Operational and management processes
  - OS-level enforcement through software monitors
  - Specialized devices, algorithms, or protocols for technical enforcement

## Non-Technical Example: House Security Policy

- **Policy**: Only family members are allowed to remove objects, and no one can enter unless accompanied by a family member.
- **Violation**: An unaccompanied stranger in the house.
- **Vulnerability**: An unlocked back door.
- **Attack**: A stranger entering through the unlocked door and stealing a TV.
- **Threat**: An individual motivated to steal and sell assets for profit.

## Conclusion

The section lays a strong foundation for understanding the intricacies of computer security policies, attacks, and the nuances between theoretical and practical aspects. The detailed overview serves as a cornerstone for both understanding and implementing robust security measures effectively.
