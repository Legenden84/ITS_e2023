# Detailed Summary: Adversary Modeling and Security Analysis (1.4)

## Introduction
The text discusses the critical aspect of computer security, focusing on the concept of adversary modeling and security analysis. Adversary modeling is vital for understanding the types of threats a system may face, and security analysis aims to find system vulnerabilities to address them.

## Key Aspects of Adversary Modeling

### Objectives
- **Adversary Objectives**: Identifies what an adversary aims to achieve, guiding which assets require special protection.

### Attributes
- **Methods**: Types of attacks or techniques anticipated.
- **Capabilities**: Includes computing resources, skills, knowledge, and opportunity.
- **Funding Level**: Influences the methods and capabilities of an attacker.
- **Insider vs. Outsider**: Determines if the attack is launched by someone with special initial access or not.

### Types of Adversaries
- **Categorical Schema**: Classifies adversaries into specific named groups.
- **Capability-Level Schema**: Groups adversaries based on their capability and intent.

## Security Evaluations and Penetration Testing

### Formal Security Evaluation
- **Third-Party Labs**: They review the product or system for compliance with security standards, often costly and time-consuming.
- **Recertification**: Required whenever even small changes are made to the system or product.

### Penetration Testing
- **Black-Box Testing**: Without using insights from design documents or source code.
- **White-Box Testing**: Utilizes design documents and source code to find vulnerabilities.

## Security Analysis Methodologies

### Source Code and Design Document Reviews
- Helps uncover vulnerabilities that are not apparent through black-box testing.

### Vulnerability Assessment
- Usually involves penetration testing to find weaknesses in deployed systems.

### Architecture Analysis
- Involves studying the system’s security architecture to see how it meets security requirements.

### Threat Modeling
- The cornerstone of security analysis, identifies assumptions and threats specific to target deployment environments.

## Security Models
- Employ abstract models to relate system components to parts of the enforced security policy.
- These models are useful both for confirming that security requirements are met and for defining those requirements in the first place.

|   | Named Groups of Adversaries                                                 |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | foreign intelligence (including government-funded agencies)                 |
| 2 | cyber-terrorists or politically-motivated adversaries                       |
| 3 | industrial espionage agents (perhaps funded by competitors)                 |
| 4 | organized crime (groups)                                                    |
| 5 | lesser criminals and crackers† (i.e., individuals who break into computers) |
| 6 | malicious insiders (including disgruntled employees)                        |
| 7 | non-malicious employees (often security-unaware)                            |

which others use for computer system experts knowledgeable about low-level details.

## Summary
The chapter outlines the importance of understanding your adversaries and systematically analyzing security attributes. It discusses formal evaluation methods, penetration testing, and diverse security analysis methodologies. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, analyze them in context, and find appropriate countermeasures.
