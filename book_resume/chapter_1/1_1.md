# Detailed Resume of Section 1.1: Fundamental Goals of Computer Security

## Introduction

This section elucidates the multi-faceted nature of computer security, describing it as an amalgamation of art, science, and engineering. The primary aim of computer security is to safeguard a range of assets—data, hardware, software, and even physical devices—from unauthorized actions and their detrimental consequences. While mechanisms that protect against unintentional damage are also important, they are not the principal focus of this section. Instead, the discussion revolves around the key properties or attributes that are essential for ensuring computer security.

## Definition of Computer Security

- **Scope**: Protects computer-related assets from unauthorized actions.
- **Assets Protected**: Data, Hardware, Software, Communications Networks, Physical-world Devices.
- **Types of Threats**: Intentional misuse by unauthorized parties.
- **Secondary Focus**: Reliability and redundancy, though not the main focus.

## Main Security Properties of Interest

### 1) Confidentiality

- **Definition**: Ensuring that non-public information is only accessible to authorized parties.
- **Mechanisms for Enforcement**:
  - Operating System-based Access Control
  - Data Encryption using Cryptographic Algorithms
- **Procedural Means**: Offline storage media accessed only by authorized individuals.

### 2) Integrity

- **Definition**: Maintaining the unaltered state of data, software, and hardware.
- **Technical Solutions**:
  - Error Detection and Correction Codes for benign errors
  - Access Controls and Cryptographic Checksums for malicious actions.
- **Human Element**: The integrity of people to resist bribery and blackmail is also important but distinct.

### 3) Authorization (Authorized Access)

- **Definition**: Making computing resources available solely to authorized entities.
- **Implementation**:
  - Access control mechanisms
  - Restricting access to physical devices, software services, and information.

### 4) Availability

- **Definition**: Keeping information, services, and computing resources accessible.
- **Requirements**:
  - Reliable Hardware and Software
  - Protection against intentional deletion and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

### Role of Principals

- **Definition**: Agents representing users, communicating entities, or system processes.
- **Privileges**: Each principal has associated privileges defining their level of resource access.

## Additional Security Goals

### 5) Authentication

- **Definition**: Assurance that the principal, data, or software is genuine.
- **Types**:
  - Entity Authentication
  - Data Origin Authentication
- **Role**: Supports Authorization and Accountability.

### 6) Accountability

- **Definition**: The traceability of actions back to responsible principals.
- **Implementation**:
  - Electronic transaction logs
  - Identifiers of principals involved.

## Special Concepts

### Trusted vs Trustworthy

- **Trusted**: Has our confidence but may not necessarily be reliable.
- **Trustworthy**: Deserves our confidence due to proven reliability.

### Confidentiality vs Privacy, and Anonymity

- **Confidentiality**: Broad protection against unauthorized information disclosure.
- **Privacy**: More focused on personal, sensitive information.
- **Anonymity**: Actions are not traceable back to an individual.

## Conclusion

The section offers a comprehensive examination of the fundamental goals crucial for achieving computer security. These range from basic attributes like confidentiality and integrity to more intricate considerations such as authentication and accountability. Understanding these objectives and the mechanisms by which they can be attained is essential for both practitioners and stakeholders involved in computer security.
