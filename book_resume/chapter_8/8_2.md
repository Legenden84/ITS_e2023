# 8.2 Certificate chain validation and certificate extensions

### Overview
The section starts by explaining that Certificate Authorities (CAs) issue certificates for different end-entities like human users or web servers. It also introduces the notion of "Intermediate CAs," which could be issued a certificate by a root CA.

### Validation Steps
The text enumerates the steps involved in validating a single certificate:
1. **Time Validity**: Ensure the certificate has not expired.
2. **Revocation Status**: Check that the certificate hasn't been revoked.
3. **Signature Verification**: Verify the signature using the CA's public key.
4. **CA Trust**: Ensure the signing CA is itself trusted.
5. **Subject Match**: Validate that the Subject or Subject-Alternate-Name fields align with the intended use of the certificate.
6. **Extension Constraints**: Ensure compliance with any certificate extension fields or policies.
7. **Certificate Chain**: If not signed by a root CA, validate the entire chain of certificates leading back to a trust anchor.

### Trust Anchors
The concept of "trust anchors" is introduced, defining them as trusted starting points for certificate chains.

### Passport Analogy
An analogy is made between countries issuing passports and CAs issuing certificates to explain the concept of independent policy constraints.

## Trust Establishment

### Out-of-Band Channels
The text describes "out-of-band channels" as channels secure from attackers and explains how they are often used to initially establish trust.

### Checking Fingerprints
This process involves retrieving a public key over an untrusted channel, calculating its hash, and cross-verifying it through an out-of-band channel.

## Types of Certificates

### Self-Signed Certificates
Explains that self-signed certificates are signed with their own private key and talks about how trust can be established through reliable out-of-band channels.

### Browser Trust Anchors
Discusses how browsers maintain a store of self-signed certificates from established CAs as a basis for trust.

## Trust Dilemmas

### Accepting Untrusted Certificates
Talks about the risks involved when a browser accepts a self-signed certificate without proper verification.

### Trust on First Use (TOFU)
Explains the concept where trust is established the first time a certificate is received without any cross-verification, highlighting the inherent risks.

### Trust Anchor Justification
Focuses on the criticality of the initial decision to trust a public key and how it can have long-term implications, especially for non-technical users.

## X.509 Version 3 Extensions

### Critical and Non-Critical Extensions
Introduces Version 3 of X.509 that added the concept of certificate extension fields, which can be either critical or non-critical.

### Examples of Extensions
- **Basic-Constraints**: Defines whether a key is for a CA and restricts certificate chain length.
- **Key-Usage**: Specifies allowed uses of a key.
- **Subject-Alternate-Name**: Can include different forms of identification like email or IP addresses.
- **Name-Constraints**: Allows control of Subject names in certificates for hierarchical namespaces.

### Cross-Certificate Pairs
Explains how cross-certificates can be issued between CAs, particularly beneficial in extending trust to an outside community.

## Exercise
Poses an exercise question exploring whether trust is transitive in real life, asking the reader to ponder upon the complexities of trust using the example of movie recommendations from friends.
