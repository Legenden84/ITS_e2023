# 8.7 Secure email: specific technologies

The text primarily focuses on detailing three end-to-end secure email technologies: S/MIME, PEM, and PGP. It discusses their features, advantages, disadvantages, and the complexities of adopting them in various settings.

### S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
- **Definition**: Described as a suite of standards for secure email compatible with existing mail transport protocols.
- **Technological Basis**: Relies on X.509v3 certificates and uses a centralized trust model.
- **Trust Anchors**: Trust in public keys is determined by CA (Certificate Authority) signatures and the configured trust anchors in mail clients.
- **Enterprise Deployments**: Typically, enterprise settings use LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to access certificate directories.
- **Email Encryption**: Only possible when the recipients have public keys available to the sender.
- **Signed-only Email**: Can be read by regular mail clients that support MIME, using S/MIME detached signatures mode.
- **Market**: Mostly targets enterprise markets.

#### Secure Email in Closed Communities
- **Deployment**: Successfully used in closed communities like large corporations and governments.
- **Challenges**: Fails to address secure communication with users outside these closed communities.
- **Options**: Discusses three potential options for interacting with outsiders: continue with plaintext email, migrate outsiders into the closed community, or use ad hoc trust management (like PGP).

### PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)
- **Historical Context**: Started in 1985, it was the first major effort to secure email.
- **Technological Basis**: Also uses X.509 certificates but had a single-root hierarchy.
- **Root CA**: Internet PCA Registration Authority (IPRA) was the root CA whose key was embedded in all PEM clients.
- **Certificate Issuance**: Policy CAs issued certificates to intermediate CAs or end-users depending on their category (enterprise, educational, residential, anonymous).
- **Revocation**: Relied on Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and made PCAs responsible for making revocation information available.
- **Successor**: Superseded by S/MIME.

### PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
- **Historical Context**: Started as open-source file encryption software in 1991.
- **Core Concepts**: Avoids centralized CAs and instead uses a "web of trust."
- **Key Trust**: Initially relied on in-person key exchanges and later incorporated the concept of "trusted introducers."
- **Transferable Keys**: Added more fields to manage bare keys better and encouraged users to upload these to PGP keyservers.

#### Challenges with PGP
- **Scalability**: Manual key exchange and web of trust don't scale well.
- **Usability**: Requires technical expertise from ordinary users.
- **Revocation**: Lacks a centralized model for key revocation.
- **Integration**: Poor integration into popular email clients affects its widespread adoption.

### Secure Email Status in Practice
- **Current Status**: Despite being a dominant communication tool, end-to-end secure email has not seen widespread adoption.
- **Challenges**: Lists several challenges such as interoperability, poor certificate and key management tools, and conflicts between stakeholders like law enforcement and privacy advocates.

In summary, the text provides a comprehensive overview of the complexities, advantages, and disadvantages of implementing end-to-end secure email technologies.
