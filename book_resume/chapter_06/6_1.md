# 6.1 Race conditions and resolving filenames to resources

## Introduction

Section 6.1 explores the intricacies of race conditions, particularly focusing on the security principle P4 (COMPLETE-MEDIATION), which requires systems to verify authorizations before granting resource access. It delves into the challenges posed by Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) races and filename-to-resource mapping in multi-processing systems.

## Principle P4 (COMPLETE-MEDIATION)

- **Explanation**: Systems should verify authorization immediately before granting access to a resource.
- **Timing Concern**: Due to "races", timing of checks and actual usage becomes a concern.

## TOCTOU Races

### What is TOCTOU Race?

- **Timing**: Access control permission is checked at time `t1` and the resource is accessed at time `t2` where `t2 > t1`.
- **Assumption**: Condition checked remains the same from Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use.
- **Reality in Multi-Processing Systems**: Things like metadata, file permissions, and owners can change between `t1` and `t2`.
- **Result**: Exploitable race conditions can exist.

### Diversity of Occurrence

These TOCTOU races are not isolated instances but have appeared across a variety of situations, requiring special attention from system developers and designers.

## Mitigating Races

### Atomic Actions and Interrupts

- **Problem**: Lines of code do not execute as an atomic pair, leading to changes in the mapping of filename to the object.
- **Desired**: Atomic actions, akin to transaction systems.
- **Why Disabling Interrupts Won't Work**: Not all interrupts can be safely disabled; multi-processor systems complicate things further.

### Suggested Alternatives

1. **Changing User IDs**: Setting the effective UID (`eUID`) to real UID (`rUID`) before `open()` call. (Non-portable across OSs)
2. **Forking**: Fork an unprivileged child to proceed with an `open()` attempt. (Also non-portable)

### Standard Means

- **Use File Descriptors**: As opposed to filenames that can change, file descriptors remain constant.
- **End Notes**: More methods are available in Section 6.9.

## Examples and Exercises

### Example: Safe-to-resolve Filenames

- **Scenario**: A user `hope` tries to make a filename "safe" by creating it in a controlled directory.
- **Issue**: Another user `tricky` can manipulate higher-level directories to change what the filename resolves to.
- **Lesson**: Ensuring "safely resolvable" filenames involves considerations up to the root directory (`/`).

### Example: `/tmp` File Exploits

- **Scenario**: A utility program (e.g., a C compiler like `gcc`) uses world-writable directories to generate temporary files.
- **Attack**: Attacker can "squat" filenames, essentially waiting to create symbolic links to filenames the utility program will generate.
- **Impact**: If the utility program has enough permissions, it could inadvertently overwrite other files.

### Exercise: TOCTOU race in Temporary File Creation

- **Pattern**: A pattern involving a `stat-open` sequence is similar to the `access-open` sequence in the first example.
- **Vulnerability**: This pattern is susceptible to an attack involving symbolic links.

## Conclusion

Section 6.1 underscores the complexity of race conditions and the associated security challenges. It provides an in-depth understanding of TOCTOU races, proposes mitigation strategies, and presents real-world examples and exercises to help understand the risks and countermeasures. A common theme is the need for system designers and developers to give special attention to these subtle but significant security vulnerabilities.
