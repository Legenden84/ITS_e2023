# 6.3 Stack-based buffer overflows

## Introduction
The text discusses stack-based buffer overflows in C and similar programming languages as a critical security vulnerability. Overflows can be accidental, leading to unpredictable behaviors like system crashes or incorrect program output. However, they are especially problematic when triggered maliciously, resulting in a buffer overflow attack.

## Memory Layout
Memory in Unix systems is organized into segments such as Stack, Text, and BSS (Block Started by Symbol). The Stack is where function-specific data like local variables and return addresses are stored. Text segment stores executable code, and BSS is essentially the data segment containing statically allocated variables.

### Function Stack Frames
When a function is called, a 'stack frame' is built to manage its local variables and control data. Overflows in stack-allocated variables can overwrite adjacent memory, including the return address for the function. If a malicious string replaces this return address, it can divert the program's control flow to unintended, potentially harmful, instructions.

## Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Attacks
In these types of attacks, the attacker supplies a string that is deliberately too long for a buffer, overwriting adjacent stack memory. By carefully crafting this input, they can replace the function's return address. This will make the program execute instructions stored in the stack, which are controlled by the attacker.

### Malicious Instruction Injection
Attackers can inject machine instructions via the overflowed buffer, effectively running arbitrary code. This code generally resides in the area of the stack that the overflow compromised.

## NO-OP Sled Technique
Creating reliable exploits requires exact knowledge of the target address where the malicious code will execute. To relax this constraint, attackers use 'NO-OP Sleds', a sequence of 'no-operation' instructions. By jumping to any instruction in this sequence, execution eventually reaches the attacker's code. To avoid detection, attackers might replace these NOP instructions with other instructions that have no significant operation, complicating detection mechanisms.

## Security Implications
- Buffer overflows expose systems to unauthorized code execution and data manipulation.
- Exploits can overwrite crucial control information, taking over program execution.
- The NO-OP Sled technique allows for a more 'forgiving' exploit, requiring less precision for the address to hijack program control.

## Conclusions
Stack-based buffer overflows are a persistent and critical security risk, particularly in languages like C, that do not prevent such overflows. They allow attackers to inject and execute malicious code, leading to unauthorized access or system crashes. The sophistication of these attacks, including tactics like NO-OP sleds, makes them hard to prevent and detect.
