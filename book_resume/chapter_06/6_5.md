# 6.5 Return-to-libc exploits

# Summary: Return-to-libc Exploits

## Introduction

The text discusses "return-to-libc" exploits, a particular type of buffer overflow attack that avoids the countermeasure of non-executable memory ranges. Unlike traditional buffer overflow attacks, which inject and execute arbitrary code, return-to-libc attacks execute pre-existing, authorized code. These attacks are typically not stopped by defenses that make stack or heap memory non-executable.

## Concept of Return-to-libc Attacks

### What It Is

A return-to-libc attack involves overwriting a return address on the stack. However, instead of pointing it to new, unauthorized code, it's set to point to existing and authorized code in a standard library (`libc`), often a system call or a well-known function.

### How It Works

The return address is overwritten with the address of an existing function in libc. The attacker also sets up the stack so that the arguments expected by the libc function are present in the correct stack locations. Essentially, it reuses existing authorized code for unauthorized purposes.

## Variants of Return-to-libc Attacks

### Stack-based Return-to-libc with `system()`

1. **Overwrite Return Address**: Like traditional buffer overflow attacks, the return address on the stack is overwritten.
2. **Point to `system()` Function**: The overwritten return address points to the `system()` function in libc.
3. **Parameter Setup**: The attacker sets up the stack so that the `system()` function's expected arguments (typically a shell command) are in place.
4. **Execution Flow**: Unix-like operating systems implement `system()` by forking a child process using `fork()` and then executing the command with `execl()`.
5. **Command Execution**: The command would be executed as if entered on a shell command line, achieving the attacker's goal.

#### Technical Example

For instance, the call to `execl()` within `system()` could be:

```c
execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", cmd, 0x00)
