# 6.8 Background: process creation, syscalls, shells, shellcode

## Overview

This section provides an extensive background for understanding how attackers exploit various aspects of system software. The content focuses on Unix-based systems but notes that other operating systems operate in a similar fashion. Topics covered include shellcode, syscalls, C Library, command shells, and process creation, among others.

## Key Concepts

### Shellcode

- **Definition**: Shellcode is a small sequence of code used to create a command shell during an attack.
- **Usage**: The goal is often to acquire a root-level shell to execute commands with root-level privileges.
- **Scope**: While traditionally used to spawn shells, shellcode now also refers to any code that accomplishes a specific attack task.

### Syscalls and C Library

- **Syscalls**: These are low-level kernel operations that interact with hardware and the operating system. They operate in the privileged CPU hardware mode, known as supervisor mode.
- **C Library (libc)**: Often, syscalls are wrapped with C language functions packaged in a user-space library, facilitating easier usage.

### Command Shells and Process Creation

- **Command Shells**: They are not part of the core OS but serve as a main interface for users.
- **Process Creation**: In Unix, when a user issues a command, the shell uses `fork()` to create a child process that then calls `execve()` to run the program.

### EXECVE Shell

- Sample C code demonstrates creating an interactive shell using the `execve()` function.

### Technical Challenges in Shellcode

- **NUL Bytes**: Elimination of NUL bytes (0x00) is important as they interfere with string-handling utilities.
- **Relative Addressing**: Addressing is often relative, as the address where the shellcode will reside is unknown.

## Key Examples

1. **Local vs Remote Attacks**: The text elaborates on how shellcode can be used both for local and remote attacks, particularly to gain a root shell.

2. **EXECVE Sample Code**: Shows how `execve()` can be used to spawn a shell.

3. **Syscall Implementation**: Explains that syscalls work closely with libc, making it easier for high-level languages to interact with the kernel.

## Common Challenges and Vulnerabilities

- **NUL Bytes**: Can interfere with how the shellcode is processed by libc functions.
- **Position Independence**: Shellcode often needs to be position-independent, but standard coding practices can address this challenge.
