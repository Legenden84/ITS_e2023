Chapter 6: "Software Securityâ€”Exploits and Privilege Escalation"

## Introduction

Chapter 6 focuses on software security, which should not be confused with security software. The chapter takes an in-depth look at the common methods used to exploit vulnerabilities in non-security software through misuse of features in programming languages, system architectures, and other supporting functionality. This exploitation is often followed by privilege escalation attempts, aiming to elevate a user from regular user level to superuser or supervisor level.

## Distinction between Software Security and Security Software

- **Software Security**: Concentrates on addressing vulnerabilities in software programs.

- **Security Software**: Tools like antivirus programs, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, which are distinct from software security.

## Key Concepts

### Malicious Software Foothold

Once malicious software gains entry into a computer system, it generally attempts to escalate its privileges from those of a regular user to superuser level (Administrator on Windows, or root in Unix/Linux). This enables the software to access all files and execute privileged commands, including changing other users' permissions.

### Memory Management

A major source of software security vulnerabilities stems from weak memory management controls. The archetypical example is exploiting buffer overflows.

## Differentiating from Other Security Problems

- **Password Theft**: Covered in Chapter 3, stealing or guessing passwords is a different avenue of attack.

- **Web-related Injection Attacks**: Discussed in Chapter 9, these are also a different class of security issues.

- **Malware Categories**: Chapter 7 talks about different types of malware based on their spreading tactics or ultimate objectives after gaining initial access. For instance, rootkits may employ buffer overflow exploits to gain initial access but use additional techniques to remain hidden.

## Importance of Understanding Attacks

The chapter emphasizes the necessity to understand how attacks work to develop effective technical defenses. Attackers are proficient in their craft and often share knowledge and toolkits online. Understanding the nitty-gritty details of how attacks are carried out dispels arguments regarding the feasibility of such attacks.

### Penetration Testing

It is even more useful to carry out live demonstrations on real systems, with prior permission, as is commonly done in penetration testing (covered in Chapter 11).

## Defensive Tools vs. Software Quality

While defensive tools like anti-virus software and firewalls are crucial, the chapter notes that the root cause of many security issues is the poor quality of the software itself. Therefore, software security has emerged as a vital sub-discipline that focuses on improving the software to make it less susceptible to attacks, independent of external security mechanisms.

## Summary

Chapter 6 underscores the importance of software security as a distinct but closely related field to general cybersecurity. It outlines the common exploits and methods used for privilege escalation, mostly stemming from poor software quality and weak memory management controls. The chapter makes a compelling case for why understanding the intricacies of these attacks is critical for formulating effective defenses, thereby elevating software security to its own dedicated sub-discipline.
