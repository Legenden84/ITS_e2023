# 10.2 Proxy firewalls and firewall architectures

## Overview
The text provides an in-depth discussion of proxy firewalls and firewall architectures, with a focus on Circuit-level proxy firewalls and Application-level filters. The text examines the roles, requirements, and functionalities of these firewall types, as well as their historical context and evolution. The discussion includes details on proxy requirements, enterprise firewall architectures, and specialized considerations like 'transparency' and 'performance'. Various terminologies, such as 'bastion host', 'dual-homed hosts', and 'DMZ' are also explained.

### 10.2 Proxy Firewalls and Firewall Architectures

#### Introduction to Proxy Firewalls
The section kicks off by defining proxy firewalls as security intermediaries between internal clients and external services. They are compared to packet filters, which primarily scrutinize network and transport headers (like IP and TCP). The text highlights two types of proxy firewalls: Circuit-level and Application-level. Circuit-level proxy firewalls primarily allow or deny a connection and relay bytes, while Application-level filters carry out application-specific processing.

#### Proxy Firewall Requirements
The section lists two crucial properties for firewall proxies:
1. **Transparency**: Ensures that user experience remains the same.
2. **Performance**: Any performance degradation should be minimal.

To achieve client software transparency, two common methods are explained:
- Proxy-aware clients: Special client application software redirects connections to a firewall proxy.
- Proxy-aware gateways: The firewall redirects tasks to specialized processors based on the application protocol fields.

#### Circuit-Level Proxies (Motivation)
The text then delves into the historical context of Circuit-level proxy firewalls. It discusses how enterprises wanted to protect their internal hosts from external threats while still providing convenient web access. It distinguishes between 'internal' and 'external' hosts based on their connectivity to the Internet.

#### Manual Gateway Solution
A first-generation solution involved the use of a gateway machine (G) connected to both the internal network and the Internet. Users would manually transfer files from the gateway to their internal machines, a process that was cumbersome but met security guidelines.

#### Firewall Proxy with Proxy-Aware Clients
An improved solution came in the form of circuit-level proxy firewalls that utilized a client-side library, a proxy server (daemon) called 'sockd', and a protocol named 'SOCKS'. This made the proxy transparent and efficient, while fulfilling enterprise-level security needs.

#### Circuit-Level Proxies (Summary)
This section summarizes the advantages and limitations of circuit-level proxies. It mentions that these proxies do not inherently provide encryption and highlights how they can be used alongside packet filters for enhanced security.

#### Application-Level Filters
The text then shifts to application-level filters, which inspect traffic based on detailed knowledge of specific application protocols. They can block or alter packets and are more suited for tasks like intrusion prevention.

#### Applications Targeted
This part elaborates on the constraints of application-level filters, such as the need for detailed knowledge of protocols, and how this limits their use to specific, often widely-used or problematic applications like remote login, file transfer, and email.

#### Bastion Hosts and Dual-Homed Hosts
Here, the text introduces the concept of 'Bastion Hosts', which are defensive hosts exposed to hostile networks and 'Dual-Homed Hosts', which are computers with two distinct network interfaces. These terms are important in the context of multi-component firewall architectures.

#### Enterprise Firewall Architectures
The final section provides an overview of various firewall architectures, progressing from a simple single screening router to more complex setups involving a network DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). It explains the principle of 'Least-Privilege' and 'Defense-in-Depth' in the context of these architectures.

### Exercise
An exercise prompts the reader to think about four relatively simple firewall architectures and their advantages over each other, pointing to an external reference for more details.
