# 10.6 â€¡Background: networking and TCP/IP

## IP AND ADDRESSES
- The **Internet Protocol (IP)** is the primary protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite for packet-switched networks.
- **Figure 10.10** on **page 300** showcases the network stack framework employed in network communications software.
- An **IP address** is:
    - A logical address that identifies an interface for data delivery.
    - Used for network routing and indicates the host's current network location.
    - Not the physical representation of the host.
- **IPv4 addresses** are:
    - 32-bit numbers.
    - Represented in dot-separated 8-bit groups.
- **IPv6 addresses** are 128 bits in length.
- On a local area network (LAN), hosts are identified by physical addresses for the delivery of data frames.
- IP addresses are linked to **MAC addresses** (media access control, not to be confused with message authentication code) through the **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**.
    - ARP broadcasts messages at the link layer.
    - ARP messages stay within a LAN and don't cross routers.

## DATAGRAMS AND PACKETS
- Packet-switched networks transfer data using intermediate devices like routers.
    - Data is transferred through **hops**.
- Data delivery involves a **datagram** made up of:
    - A header for delivery facilitation.
    - A payload intended for the recipient.
- A datagram can be up to **65,535 bytes**, determined by a 16-bit length field.
- Data units called **packets** are used for the delivery of data in each hop.
    - Their size is limited by the **maximum transmission unit (MTU)**.
    - For instance, the maximum payload of Ethernet is 1500 bytes.
- If a datagram's size surpasses the MTU, it gets fragmented to fit within data frames.
    - Fragments can be reassembled using a fragment offset header field.

## TCP AND UDP
- **IP datagrams** carry data like TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** are transport-layer protocols.
    - UDP:
        - Connectionless, like IP.
        - Provides one-way delivery of datagrams.
        - Doesn't maintain a state or guarantee delivery.
        - Doesn't remove duplicate packets.
    - TCP:
        - Connection-oriented.
        - Ensures reliable two-way data flows.
        - Delivers data in sequence to upper layers.
        - Ends a connection with errors if delivery can't be assured.
    - The **TCP segment** is what's inside the IP datagram beyond its header.
        - The payload of TCP contains application protocol data like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

## PORTS AND SOCKETS
- **Ports** allow multiple services to be hosted by servers.
    - Direct data units to the correct application or service.
    - Port numbers are 16 bits in size.
- Network daemons allow servers to offer services by listening on specific ports.
    - Ports 0-1023 are generally used by well-known network protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, DNS, POP3, and IMAP.
    - Ports from 1024-65,535 are typically not privileged.
    - Clients use short-lived ports, mostly between 1024-5000, for their end of TCP connections.
- An IP socket is determined by a combination of an IP address and port number.
    - TCP connections link source and destination sockets.
    - Software accesses these sockets through file descriptors.
    - UDP has its own set of ports but uses only destination sockets because of its connectionless nature.

## TCP HEADER, TCP CONNECTION SET-UP
- **Figure 10.15** depicts a TCP header with its flag bits.
- For setting up a TCP connection before data transfer, three messages with headers but devoid of data are needed.
    - The client sends a SYN message.
    - The server replies with both SYN and ACK flags set.
    - The client then sends an ACK message.
    - This sequence (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) is termed the three-way handshake.
- Connection termination:
    - Can begin in an orderly fashion with one end sending a FIN bit, awaiting an acknowledgement, and then sending their own FIN bit.
    - Can also be done using the reset flag (RST) for an abrupt release.

## ICMP
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** is an auxiliary network-layer protocol equivalent to IP.
    - Utilized for transmitting errors, diagnostics, and other control messages.
    - ICMP messages have a body inside an IP datagram after its header.
    - This body includes a single 32-bit word, with the content varying based on type and code.
- Various ICMP message types include:
    - 3: Destination unreachable.
    - 5: Redirect.
    - 8: Echo request (like the ping utility).
    - 11: Time exceeded.
    - The ping utility, which uses the echo request, checks the connection between TCP/IP hosts.
    - ICMP messages can be filtered by firewalls based on their type and code fields.
