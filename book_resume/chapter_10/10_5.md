# 10.5 IPsec: IP security suite (details)

# Detailed Description of Text on IPsec (IP Security Suite)

## Introduction to IPsec
The text dives into the Internet Protocol Security Suite, commonly known as IPsec, and explains how it is designed to add a layer of security to the Internet Protocol (IP). Unlike the standard IP, which provides no security services such as encryption or authentication, IPsec aims to automatically provide these network-layer security services for all transport and application layer protocols. This is in contrast to TLS and SSH, which only secure application-layer protocols when invoked.

## Three Main Components of IPsec
IPsec is composed of three main protocols: IKE for key management, AH for authentication, and ESP for both encryption and authentication.

### IKE (Internet Key Exchange)
IKE automates the establishment of cryptographic keys using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. In IPsec, a phase of parameter negotiation occurs to set up protocol details between endpoints. The result is a shared state consisting of agreed-upon algorithms, sequence numbers, and cryptographic keys, known as a Security Association (SA). Separate SAs are used for each communication direction. SAs are indexed by an SPI (Security Parameters Index), and IPsec headers include an SPI field.

### AH (Authentication Header)
The text explains that AH provides a Message Authentication Code (MAC) for data origin authentication. The MAC covers the payload and certain fields in the IP header that are immutable during transit. AH also optionally provides replay protection through its sequence number field, alongside other details from the stored SA data identified by the SPI field.

### ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)
ESP provides both encryption and authentication. Unlike AH, ESP's MAC does not cover any IP header fields. The text also shows how ESP fields are arranged within an IP packet.

## IPsec Modes
IPsec can operate in two modes: Transport mode and Tunnel mode.

### Transport Mode
In this mode, IPsec provides end-to-end Virtual Private Network (VPN) security between two hosts. The IPsec header is placed between the original IP header and the payload. This mode cannot be used if one endpoint is a network since the resulting IPsec packet has only one IP header.

### Tunnel Mode
This mode is for network-to-network VPNs and host-to-network VPNs. The text explains that in this mode, the entire original IP datagram becomes the payload for the IPsec packet, which is then preceded by an IPsec header and a new IP header.

## Challenges and Deployment of IPsec
The text acknowledges that IPsec is often described as "heavyweight" due to its large code base and complexity. Running an IPsec VPN often requires dedicated experts. Three deployment approaches are outlined:
1. OS kernel build-in: Incorporating IPsec into the core TCP/IP network stack.
2. Bump in the stack: Inserting a layer between existing network and link layers.
3. Bump in the wire: Deploying IPsec through inline hardware.

## IPsec Policies
IPsec allows policy-based packet filtering. Policies are maintained in an IPsec Security Policy Database and may depend on various fields in IP and transport-layer headers or other conditions specified within IKE.

## ESP Configurations
The text outlines different ESP configurations including an authenticate-only mode, an encrypt-only mode, and an option for ESP protection followed by AH.

## Exercises and Discussion Points
The text ends with exercises that prompt the reader to delve into specific aspects like IPsec's anti-replay services, NAT incompatibilities, and utility of AH. It also includes a section discussing WireGuard, an alternative to IPsec and OpenVPN, asking the reader to summarize its major architectural design choices.
