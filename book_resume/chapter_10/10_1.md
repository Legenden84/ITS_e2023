# 10.1 Packet-filter firewalls

## Introduction
The text opens by defining what a network security firewall is, highlighting its role as a gateway that controls data passage between two networks or a network and a device. The text emphasizes that ideally, no traffic should bypass the firewall (COMPLETE-MEDIATION, principle P4). It also draws a parallel to fire-resistant doors that contain fire spread (ISOLATED-COMPARTMENTS, principle P5). The primary application of these firewalls is to protect a private (internal) network from an untrusted public (external) one, typically the Internet.

## Inbound and Outbound Traffic
The text breaks down packet traffic into inbound (entering the internal network) and outbound (exiting the internal network) types. Inbound packets are filtered to protect the internal network, while outbound packets are monitored and optionally controlled to adhere to security policies.

## Types of Firewalls
The text specifies two main categories of firewalls: packet-filter firewalls and proxy-type firewalls. The rest of the section focuses primarily on packet-filter firewalls.

### Packet-Filter Rules and Actions
Packet-filter firewalls are configured with rules, each having a condition and an action. The text lists three primary actions:
- ALLOW: Lets the packet pass through.
- DROP: Discards the packet silently.
- REJECT: Discards the packet and notifies the source.

Optionally, a secondary action may log the packet. Rule conditions are primarily based on five TCP/IP header fields: source address, source port, destination address, destination port, and protocol.

### Stateless vs. Stateful Filters
Stateless filters treat each packet independently, while stateful filters maintain a state table to reference for future packets. The text explains that stateful firewalls often track details like TCP connection states.

### Example Rules
An example with sample filtering rules is provided. These rules are categorized into blocks handling different types of traffic: spoofing mitigation, SMTP email, HTTP, DNS, ICMP ping, and a default deny rule.

## Security Policies
The text stresses that a packet-filter firewall is an implementation of an organization's Internet security policy. The firewall uses rules to control the kinds of packets that can enter or exit an enterprise network. It notes that while it's tempting to allow traffic by default (default-allow), a default-deny policy is safer.

## Limitations of Firewalls
The text outlines various limitations:
- Topological Limitations: Assumes true perimeters exist.
- Malicious Insiders: Inside the firewall, everyone is trusted, which could be a problem.
- Trusted Users Making Bad Connections: No protection against users initiating dangerous connections.
- Firewall Transit by Tunneling: Rules based on port numbers can be bypassed.
- Encrypted Content: Makes content-based inspection difficult.

## Firewall as Chokepoints
Firewalls serve as a centralized point for monitoring, control, and packet rejection. However, the text acknowledges the weakening of the perimeter model, citing instances like wireless access points and BYOD environments.

## Types of Firewall Installations
Firewalls can be installed as standalone hardware or as a part of multi-function devices. Standalone firewalls have the advantage of a smaller attack surface and are generally administered by experts.

## Personal and Distributed Firewalls
The text concludes by discussing host-based firewalls, which are built into individual hosts. These are important for hosts on untrusted networks and allow for user-specific security configurations. However, they also present trade-offs between security and user convenience.

## Exercises and Additional Topics
The text also contains various exercises and additional topics like dynamic packet filtering in FTP, network address translation (NAT), and the `iptables` tool in Linux, encouraging the reader to explore these areas further.
