# 10.3 SSH: Secure Shell

The content focuses on Secure Shell (SSH), providing an in-depth explanation of its purpose, structure, functionalities, and security aspects. It serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding how SSH operates as a secure means of communication over the Internet.

## Introduction
- It starts by identifying the absence of built-in security services in the Internet Protocol (IP).
- Discusses two approaches to compensate for this lack of security: application-level implementations and lower-level generic security services.
- Introduces SSH as a widely used protocol designed in 1995 that takes the latter approach of building security into lower levels of the communication stack.

## SSH Overview
- Explains that SSH replaces prior insecure protocols like `rlogin`, `telnet`, `rsh`, `rcp`, and `ftp`.
- Emphasizes that SSH provides encryption for both passwords and data sent via TCP.
- Notes that SSH doesn't provide a shell itself but an encrypted tunnel to reach a shell or other programs.
- Introduces utilities built using SSH like `scp` and `sftp` for secure file transfer.

## Remote Shell Via SSH
- Provides a figure (`Figure 10.5`) demonstrating the use of SSH for a remote shell.
- Discusses the architecture involving `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `ssh`, and `sshd` for communication between local and remote hosts.

## Three Protocols Composing SSH
1. **Transport Layer Protocol**: Takes care of server authentication, encryption, and integrity.
2. **User Authentication Protocol**: Handles client-to-server authentication.
3. **Connection Protocol**: Allows the usage of one SSH connection for multiple purposes, called multiplexing.

## SSH Client Authentication
- Details the server's declaration of allowed client authentication methods, such as password, Kerberos ticket, and client public keys.
- Explains a typical public key-based client authentication mechanism.

## SSH Server Authentication
- Discusses server-side authentication using public keys.
- Talks about the trust models, including "trust on first use" and more secure, enterprise-level methods.

## Trust Models for SSH Host Keys
- Introduces two models:
  1. **Model 1**: Manual acceptance and storing of keys in a client database.
  2. **Model 2**: CA-certified SSH server keys.

## User Authentication Method Confusion
- Describes the possible confusion between password and public key methods for users when a passphrase is used to protect the private key.

## SSH Port Forwarding
- Explains SSH's ability to securely tunnel legacy applications via port forwarding.
- Demonstrates the command syntax for local port forwarding with SSH.

## How SCP Works
- Uses `Figure 10.7` to illustrate how SCP, a secure file transfer mechanism, operates.
- Breaks down the `scp` command syntax and how the file transfer occurs through an SSH tunnel.

## SSH X11 Forwarding
- Discusses the X11 forwarding feature in SSH for forwarding graphical user interfaces.

## Trusted Login Hosts
- Describes the risky "trusted" login hosts feature from Unix history that used to allow password-free remote logins.
- Mentions that this mechanism is strongly discouraged and places it in the context of SSH's introduction.

## Port 22 for SSH
- Shares a historical anecdote from Tatu Ylonen, the inventor of SSH, about why port 22 was chosen for SSH.

## Exercises and Examples
- Includes various exercises for the reader, such as drawing diagrams for remote port forwarding, comparing various file transfer protocols, and discussing authentication methods.
- Talks about PuTTY as an example of SSH client tools and lists secure replacements for traditional protocols.
