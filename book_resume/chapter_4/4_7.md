# Detailed Resume of Text on Single Sign-On (SSO) and Federated Identity Systems

## Introduction
The text discusses Single Sign-On (SSO) systems, an architectural framework that allows users to authenticate only once to access multiple services or resources. This architecture involves third-party entities known as Identity Providers (IdPs) and Service Providers (SPs or RPs, Relying Parties). SSO offers centralized management but also comes with the downside of concentrated risk. It also mentions single credential systems as a related but different concept.

## Key Concepts

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
- **Definition**: SSO allows a user to log in once and access multiple services without re-authenticating.
- **Components**:
  - **Users**: Have one master credential (e.g., userid-password or hardware token).
  - **Identity Providers (IdPs)**: Involved in initial authentication and provide data tokens for later use.
  - **Service Providers (SPs/Relying Parties)**: Services accessed by the users after initial authentication.
- **Advantages**:
  - Centralized account management.
  - Easier access management.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Concentrated Risk.
  - Losing a master credential can lock out many resources.

### Single Credential System
- **Definition**: Users have one master credential but must explicitly log in to each service.

## Types of SSO Systems

### 1. Credential Manager Systems
- **Includes**: Password Managers.
- **Functionality**: Manages SP-specific credentials usually encrypted under a key derived from a master credential.
- **Use Case**: Simplifying individual password management.

### 2. Enterprise SSO Systems
- **Domain**: Single administrative domain.
- **Community**: Closed, typically corporate or governmental.
- **Example**: Kerberos in universities and Windows-based systems.

### 3. Federated Identity Systems (FI)
- **Domain**: Multiple administrative domains.
- **Community**: Open, including websites looking to lower registration barriers.
- **Also Known As**: Web SSO systems when browsers are the user agents.

## Federated Identity Systems - Design Aspects
- **Protocols for**: User identity registration, user-to-IdP authentication, IdP-to-SP authentication.
- **Federation Operator**: Sets administrative and security policies.
- **User Authentication**: Can be local (on a personal device) or remote (over the web).

## Kerberos Protocol
- **Objective**: Provides mutual entity authentication and authenticated key establishment.
- **Components**:
  - **Client A**: The user.
  - **Server B**: The service provider.
  - **KDC T**: Key Distribution Center.
- **Protocol Steps**:
  1. A → T: Initial request with nonce from A.
  2. A ← T: Returns ticket and session key encrypted for A.
  3. A → B: Sends ticket and authenticator to B.
  4. A ← B: B verifies and returns timestamp, authenticating itself to A.
- **Requirements**: Secure synchronized time clocks.

### Ticket Granting Tickets (TGT)
- An initial TGT token is obtained upon logging in.
- Used to get service tickets, replacing steps 1 and 2 in the Kerberos protocol.
- More recognizable as an enterprise SSO system.

## Summary
The text provides a comprehensive overview of SSO systems, their types, components, advantages, and disadvantages. It also delves into the design aspects of Federated Identity systems and outlines the Kerberos protocol for mutual authentication.
