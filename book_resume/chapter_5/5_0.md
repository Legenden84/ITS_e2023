# Resume of Chapter 5: Operating System Security and Access Control

## Introduction
The chapter delves into the history and evolution of Operating System (OS) security and access control mechanisms. It spans from the mass production of computers in the 1950s to the golden age of OS design from 1965-1975. The chapter outlines how certain fundamental aspects of OS security have remained consistent, even though the threat landscape has evolved.

## Historical Context
- **1950s**: Emergence of mass-produced computers
- **1960s**: Time-sharing systems spotlight the need for security
- **1965-1975**: Golden design era for OS protection mechanisms, featuring hardware protection and address translation

## Core Challenges
- **Past vs Present**: Although the environment was simpler in the past with fewer networks and software, the basic challenges were the same as today.
  - Separation of processes
  - Resource sharing
  - Access restrictions to programs and resources

## Protection Mechanisms
- **Memory Control**: Initially, "protection" was largely about controlling access to memory locations. This is significant because:
  - Both data and programs are stored in memory
  - Input/output devices and communications channels are accessed via memory addresses and files
- **Virtual Memory & Access Control Lists**: The early designs combined memory address restrictions with virtual memory address translation. Access control lists were developed to manage resource sharing.

## Basis for General Access Control
- Memory and file access control serve as a general foundation for controlling access to various objects and devices.

## Case Studies
- **Unix**: Chosen for discussion due to its widespread use and various adaptations including Linux.
- **Multics**: A system from 1964-67 that stands as an exemplar in the OS field.
  - Segmented Virtual Addressing
  - Access Control Mechanisms
  - Protection Rings

### Unix
- Many flavors and cousins (e.g., Linux)
- Good choice for detailed discussion given its versatility and widespread use

### Multics
- Heavily influenced later systems
- Rich and detailed technical literature that serves as a valuable resource
- Distinguished by its careful engineering among both early and modern systems

## Key Takeaways
- Learning about historical and fundamental protection mechanisms in operating systems provides a strong foundation for understanding contemporary computer security challenges.
- Rather than giving an exhaustive account of all major operating systems, the chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding through the features of a few real, specific systems like Unix and Multics.
