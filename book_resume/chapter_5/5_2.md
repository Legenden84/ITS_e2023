## Extended Resume of Section 5.2 on Reference Monitor, Access Matrix, and Security Kernel

### Introduction
This section introduces key concepts essential for understanding advanced protection mechanisms in computer systems. These include the reference monitor concept, the access matrix, and the security kernel. These ideas were initially conceived for securing government systems against malicious users.

### Reference Monitor Concept

#### Definition
- **Proposed in 1972**: Aims to create a secure framework for systems, especially those deployed for government use.
- **Basic Notion**: Any program's references to other programs, data, or devices are validated against a list of authorized references, contingent on the user and/or program function.

#### Subject-Object Model
- **Subject (or Principal)**: An entity that requests access to a system object.
- **Object**: Items like active processes, memory addresses, code and data, peripheral devices, and privileged instructions that a subject may request to interact with.

### Access Matrix

#### Conceptualization
- An **access matrix** is used to model authorized interactions between subjects and objects.
- **Rows**: Represent subjects.
- **Columns**: Represent objects.
- **Access Control Entries (ACEs)**: Entries A(i, j) in the matrix that specify the permissions subject `i` has for object `j`.

#### Types of Access
- Read/Write: For data items or memory addresses.
- Execute: For code.
- Wakeup/Terminate: For processes.
- Search: For directories.
- Delete: For files.

#### Efficiency Concerns
- A direct 2D implementation is inefficient because the matrix is usually large and sparse.

### Reference Monitor Implementation

#### Software-Hardware Mechanism
- A software-hardware mechanism validates the reference monitor model.
- May consist of a collection of monitors, each protecting different classes of objects.

#### Mediation Process
- Every access request `(i, j, z)` from subject `i` to object `j` is intercepted.
- The request is authorized only if entry A(i, j) permits the access type `z`.

### Security Kernel Requirements
- **Tamper-proof**: Cannot be altered illicitly.
- **Always Invoked**: Cannot be circumvented.
- **Verifiable**: Small enough for thorough testing and analysis.
- Forms the core of a secure system but is rarely implemented fully in mainstream operating systems.

### Dependencies
- Requires a trustworthy authentication system, secure hardware, physical security, and secure input-output communication paths.

### Access Control Implementations

#### Capability Lists (C-Lists)
- Focused on subjects.
- Detail all privileges a subject holds across different objects.

#### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Focused on objects.
- Specify which subjects have what type of access to a particular object.

### Protection Mechanisms

#### Ticket-Oriented vs. ID-Based
- **Capabilities (Tickets)**: A token allowing access, irrespective of identity.
- **ID-Based**: Access granted based on verified identity.

### Basis for Audit Trails
- Reference monitors offer a foundation for building fine-grained audit logs that aid in debugging, accountability, intruder detection, and forensic investigations.

### Exercises
1. **Access control of ACLs**: Discusses questions on how an ACE is subject to access control and more.
2. **Implementing capabilities**: Talks about the different ways capabilities can be implemented to prevent tampering.
3. **Access control and USB drives**: Explores which system accounts get access when a USB is plugged in.
4. **Access control through encryption**: Discusses how access to documents can be controlled via web servers and encryption, with the provision for an audit trail.
