# Summary of Object Permissions and File-based Access Control

## Introduction to Object Permissions

### Access Control Basics
The chapter initially delves into the foundational concept of access control by examining how memory segments were used for early protection. This laid the groundwork for more abstract objects and their permissions, utilizing access control lists (ACLs).

### Object-based Access Control
A more focused approach in the object-based access control is the subject-object permission framework. In this framework, after specifying the subjects and objects, the types of access operations are identified and framed as permissions for consideration.

## File-based Access Control in Unix Systems

### Introduction to File-based Access Control
A practical way to explore object-level access permissions is through the concept of logical files. File-based access control, especially in Unix systems, goes beyond just the file’s data and considers the per-file meta-data specifying access permissions.

### Design Principles
Unix and Multics adhere to the principle of treating everything as a file, which simplifies I/O operations across a wide range of devices. Thus, studying file permissions is equivalent to understanding access control on various resources.

## Alternatives to ACLs

### Disadvantages of ACLs
While ACLs offer fine-grained control, they have their drawbacks, such as being memory-intensive, requiring frequent updates, and being complex to manage.

### UGO Architecture
An alternative to ACLs is the User-Group-Others (UGO) architecture, which is less expressive but more efficient. This model became popular long ago and continues to be widely used.

## File Ownership in Unix Systems

### User ID and Group ID
Unix systems assign each file an owner and a protection group, represented by User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID). These IDs are initially set based on the creating process.

### File Information Storage
The IDs correspond to entries in Unix files `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`, which store details about usernames, their UIDs, GIDs, and group memberships.

### Superuser and Root
Superuser is a special case where the process runs with UID=0, giving it access to all file resources. Typically, the username "root" is associated with UID=0, although technically it could be assigned to other UIDs.

## User-Group-Others Model

### Introduction to UGO
The UGO model categorizes principals into three classes: user (file owner), group (file's protection group), and others (everyone else). This model allows for compact and efficient management of permissions.

### Limitations of UGO
While the UGO model saves storage and processing time by keeping permissions data compact, it lacks the expressiveness of ACLs.

## Meta-data and File Permissions

### Permission Fields
The UGO mechanism utilizes a specific data structure with fields like UID, GID, and 9 protection bits to enforce permissions on files. The bits control read (R), write (W), and execute (X) permissions.

### Permission Check Sequence
When a user process requests access to a file, permissions are checked in the sequence of user, group, and others. The first qualifying category determines the granted permissions.

### Display Notation
Permissions are visually displayed as a 10-character string like `-rwxr-xr--`, where each set of three characters after the first represents the permissions for user, group, and others.

## Additional Concepts and Exercises

### Initial Permission Values
Permissions can be set at file creation using a 12-bit mode parameter, which is then modified by the user’s 9-bit file creation “unset” mask (umask).

### Unix Commands
Commands like `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` allow for modifying file permissions, ownership, and group settings, respectively.

### Swapped Memory and ACLs
The chapter also touches on topics like how paging works in terms of access control and how UGO permissions can be supplemented with ACLs for enhanced access control.

## Exercises

1. File permissions can be experimented with using the `touch` and `ls -l` commands.
2. `chmod` can change a file’s 9-bit protection mode.
3. `chown` and `chgrp` can change file ownership and group.
4. Discuss protection mechanisms in swapped memory.
5. ACLs can be managed using `getfacl` and `setfacl` commands.
