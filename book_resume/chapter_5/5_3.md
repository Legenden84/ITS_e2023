## Resume of Chapter 5.3: Object Permissions and File-Based Access Control

### Introduction
The chapter begins with an overview of object permissions and their evolution. It provides an understanding of how early memory segment-based protection evolved into abstract object-based access controls. The focus then shifts to file-based access control systems, especially in Unix environments.

### File-Based Access Control
#### Unix Systems
- The chapter explains the significance of file-based access control in Unix systems, emphasizing its pedagogical and practical importance.
- Early design principles in Multics and Unix treated everything as a file, which simplified I/O operations across devices.
- File permissions are more than just controls for file data; they generalize to access controls for all sorts of resources.

---

### ACL Alternatives
#### Advantages and Disadvantages
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide fine-grained control but come with disadvantages such as memory consumption, the need for frequent updates, and the potential tediousness of listing all principals requiring access.

#### UGO Architecture
- A less expressive but efficient alternative, the ugo (user, group, others) architecture, is introduced, and its discussion is deferred to later sections after covering file ownership details.

---

### File Owner and Group in Unix Systems
- Every file in Unix has an owner (`UID`) and a protection group (`GID`).
- UID and GID are numeric values initialized when the file is created.
- `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files store user and group details.

---

### Superuser vs. Root
- `UID=0` grants superuser status, providing unrestricted access.
- Although "root" is conventionally the superuser, it's the UID value of 0 that truly matters.

---

### User-Group-Others (UGO) Model
#### Three Principal Categories
1. **User**: File owner.
2. **Group**: Enables resource sharing among a small set of users.
3. **Others**: Defines permissions for everyone else.

- UGO is efficient because it involves bit-operations on fixed-size metadata, although it is less expressive than ACLs.

---

### Meta-Data and File Permissions
- Permissions are stored in a per-file filesystem data structure.
- The structure contains:
  1. `user`: Owner's UID.
  2. `group`: File's GID.
  3. `9 bits`: 3 bits each for user, group, and others (R, W, X).
  4. `3 bits`: Special protection bits (setuid, setgid, t-bit).

---

### Use of Protection Bits
- The system checks permissions in a sequential manner: user, group, then others.
- First qualifying category determines privileges.

---

### Permission Display Notation
- Permissions are often displayed as a 10-character string (e.g., `-rwxr-xr--`).
- Each character signifies a specific type of permission (R, W, X, or - for none).

---

### Initial File Permissions
- File permissions are initially set using a 12-bit mode parameter and post-modified by the creator’s 9-bit `umask`.
- A common default is 666 (RW for all), and a common mask is 022 (remove W for group and others), yielding 644.

---

### Advanced Topics
- Exercises are included to explore setting/modifying file permissions, changing file owner and groups, and understanding access control in swapped memory.
- Additional layer of ACLs can augment the UGO architecture.
- Commands like `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`, `getfacl`, and `setfacl` are introduced for modifying permissions and ACLs.

Table 5.1: Symbolic notation to display Unix file permissions R/read, W/write, X/execute.
Combinations shown are to explain notation, rather than useful combinations. In symbolic
notation, a leftmost “d” indicates a directory (rather than a permission). The three special
bits (leftmost) are displayed symbolically by modifying an “x” letter as per Fig. 5.5.
