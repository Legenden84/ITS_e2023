# Detailed Resume of Setuid bit and Effective Userid (eUID) Text

## Introduction
The text discusses the `setuid` bit, which is one of the three "special" permission bits in Unix-based operating systems. It goes into depth about how this bit affects the process execution permissions and security implications, touching upon the Real User ID (`rUID`), Effective User ID (`eUID`), and Saved User ID (`sUID`). The text also briefly discusses the related `setgid` bit, and uses examples to demonstrate how these features are used in real-world applications.

## SETUID Bit

### Basic Functionality
- The `setuid` bit is a permission bit that can be set by a file owner for any binary executable file they own.
- When a process with execute (`X`) permission runs a file with the `setuid` bit enabled, the Operating System (OS) temporarily sets the effective user ID (`eUID`) of that process to the file owner's user ID.

### Purpose
- It enables the file (usually a program) to access resources that the calling process might not have sufficient permissions to access.
- It essentially allows the calling process more access than it otherwise would, but under the constraint of a carefully designed and trustworthy fixed-functionality program.

### Security Implications
- This feature is often used for programs that need to access security-critical system resources.
- Because of the elevated permissions, such programs become targets for attackers, especially if the file owner is the root user.

### Use Cases
- Not just limited to root-owned files, `setuid` programs owned by regular users can also be beneficial, e.g., to allow others controlled access to that user’s files.

## Real User ID, Effective User ID, and Saved User ID

### Definitions
- **Real User ID (`rUID`)**: Denotes the actual owner of the process.
- **Effective User ID (`eUID`)**: Used in determining the permissions for resource access and is set by the OS based on the `setuid` bit.
- **Saved User ID (`sUID`)**: Facilitates switching between `rUID` and `eUID`.

### System Calls
- `getuid()` and `geteuid()` return `rUID` and `eUID`, respectively.
- `setuid()`, `seteuid()`, and `setreuid()` allow setting these IDs, but detailed mechanics are not discussed in the text.

### Example
- The `su` command (Substitute User Identity) is cited as an example, which executes a new shell with `rUID`, `eUID`, and `sUID` set to the user ID of the specified user.

## SETGID Bit

### Functionality
- Analogous to `setuid` but affects the file’s protection group.
- Corresponding system values are `rGID`, `eGID`, `sGID`.

### System Calls
- Similar to the setuid system calls, it has `getgid()`, `getegid()`, `setgid()`.

## Examples and Applications

### Changing Passwords
- Unix users use the `passwd` command to change their passwords.
- `/usr/bin/passwd` often has the setuid bit set and is root-owned, enabling write access to the system password file.

### Process Creation
- The `fork()` system call is used for process creation, which replicates the parent process to create a child.
- Both run the same code initially, and the child inherits the parent's user IDs (`rUID`, `eUID`, `sUID`).

### Login
- The `login` command runs a root-owned setuid program, which prompts for username-password, performs verification, and initializes various settings before executing the user’s shell.

## Display Rules
- If a file’s `setuid` or `setgid` bit is set, it is displayed in a 10-character notation where an `x` changes to `s` and a `-` changes to `S`.
- `S` is not useful since `setuid` or `setgid` have no effect without execute permission.

## Summary

The `setuid` bit and its cousins (`setgid`, `rUID`, `eUID`, `sUID`) are crucial elements in Unix-like systems, offering both functionality and potential risks. They allow controlled elevation of privileges but must be used carefully to avoid security vulnerabilities.
