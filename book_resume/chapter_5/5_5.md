# 5.5 Directory permissions and inode-based example

## Introduction
- This section talks about the unique attributes of permission bits when applied to directory files in Unix filesystems.
- It also explains the structure of Unix filesystems with a focus on inode and datablock components.

## Unix Directory Structure
- Unix filesystems have a rooted tree with the top named as `/`.
- Leaf nodes are regular files while interior nodes are directory files.
- Meta-data for each file is stored in an inode.
  - Relevant Meta-data includes:
    - Permission data
    - A flag distinguishing directory files
    - A pointer (datalink) to the datablock
- A directory file's datablock contains filesystem data in the form of entries (d-name, d-inode).
- The first two directory entries are always `.` (the directory itself) and `..` (the parent directory).

## Directory Permissions
- Permissions for directory files differ from regular files and are denoted as LAT bits (List, Alter, Traverse).
### Permission Types:
  - **R**: Allows listing of directory content but not access to files' content or their metadata.
  - **W**: Allows alteration of directory content, requires **X** to be useful. Can rename, delete, and create new entries.
  - **X**: Allows traversing and searching the directory, including setting it as the working directory and accessing inode meta-data of listed files.
- **setuid**: Typically meaningless for directory files.
- **setgid**: Makes group sharing easier by setting the group value of a new file to the directory's GID.
- **t-bit**: Prevents deletion or renaming of files in the directory that are owned by other users.

## Special Cases
### Sticky Bit
- Particularly useful in world-writable directories like `/tmp` to prevent malicious activities.

### World-Writable Files
- Notably dangerous, especially when owned by the root.

## Practical Examples and Exercises
### Finding World-Writable Files
- Can use the `find` command to search for world-writable files.

### Directory Creation Example
- The steps that occur when creating a new directory, `/NBAwest/Warriors`, are elaborated.
  1. A new inode instance for Warriors is created.
  2. A new datablock with initial directory entries is created.
  3. A new entry for "Warriors" is added to the parent directory's datablock.
  4. System calls to `link()` are made to fix null pointers in the datablock entries.

### Unexpected Detail
- The string "Warriors" exists only in the parent directory's entry, allowing the same file to have different names under different parents.

### Initial Values for Permission Bits
- A new Unix directory usually gets 9 RWX bits assigned with common defaults being 777 and 755 after applying the mask 022.

### Exercises
- Explore properties of directories using `ls` command.
- Discuss whether permission bits in inode structures constrain customized software tools that explore backup data.
- Discuss limitations and preferences between `chroot jails` and the newer `jail()` for filesystem visibility restrictions.
