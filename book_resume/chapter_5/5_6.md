# 5.6 Symbolic links, hard links and deleting files

## Overview

The text discusses the security implications related to file links in Unix-based operating systems. It outlines the mechanism through which a single non-directory file can be represented in multiple directories, often under different names. The key methods for creating such links are through the `ln` command, creating either a symbolic link (symlink) or a hard link. Each of these link types functions differently when it comes to deletion and renaming.

## Types of Links

### Hard Links

#### Definition
- A hard link is essentially a direct alias to an existing file.

#### Example
- Running the command `ln existing new1` will create a new directory entry named `new1` that points to the same inode as the file `existing`.

#### Characteristics
- Multiple directory entries can point to the same file but may name it differently.
- The syntax for creating hard links could allow directory files to be hard-linked as well.

#### Limitations
- Hard-linking directories is usually discouraged or outright disallowed due to potential issues with directory loops.

### Symbolic Links (Symlinks)

#### Definition
- A symbolic link is an indirect alias that points to another file.

#### Example
- The command `ln -s existing new2` creates a new inode for an item named `new2`, which points symbolically to the file `existing`.

#### Characteristics
- Unlike hard links, symlinks get a new inode.
- If the original file (`existing`) is moved or deleted, symlinks to it will fail, but hard links will still work.

## Deleting Files and Links

### General Concept
- Deleting a file essentially removes its name from the list of a directory but doesn't actually remove the file (inode and datablock) from the filesystem.

### Deletion with Different Types of Links
- Deleting a symlink only removes the directory entry but doesn't affect the original file.
- Deleting a hard link removes that specific directory entry, and the file itself is deleted only when the link count (number of hard links pointing to the inode) drops to zero.

### Filesystem Design
- Inodes in Unix don't live in directories; they exist independently.
- Directory entries simply serve as an organizational structure for inodes.

## Figures for Reference
- The text recommends examining Figures 5.8 and 5.9 for a better understanding of how deletion impacts different types of links.

## Security Implications
- The text suggests that understanding these link mechanisms is critical for addressing security issues related to file links.

## Conclusion
- Understanding the intricacies of hard links and symbolic links, as well as how deletion works in Unix, is crucial for both system organization and security.
