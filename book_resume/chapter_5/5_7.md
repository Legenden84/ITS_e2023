# 5.7 Role-based (RBAC) and mandatory access control

## Overview

The text provides an overview of various types of access control mechanisms in computing, with an emphasis on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC). It also touches upon Discretionary Access Control (DAC) for comparison. Special attention is given to the implementation examples like SELinux and its adaptability in Android OS known as SEAndroid.

## Types of Access Control

### Mandatory Access Control (M-AC)

#### Definition
- Mandatory Access Control (M-AC) is enforced by a security policy administrator who sets permissions for every object and subject in the system.

#### Models
- One of the M-AC models is the Multi-Level Security (MLS) model by the U.S. Department of Defense, which assigns security clearance levels to users and classifies documents (e.g., Top Secret, Secret, etc.).

#### Permission Basis
- Usually, permissions are assigned based on the subject identity (userID).

### Discretionary Access Control (D-AC)

#### Definition
- In Discretionary Access Control (D-AC), the resource owner has the discretion to set permissions on that resource.

#### Examples
- Multics and Unix-style file permissions are instances of D-AC.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Definition
- In RBAC, a user (subject) is assigned one or more roles, each pre-loaded with a set of permissions, which determines the subject's overall permissions.

#### Example
- For instance, a role `GradAdmin` could have read and write access to certain department files. A user like Alex with this role would inherit these permissions.

#### Characteristics
- Roles can be hierarchically defined, e.g., a `SeniorManager` role might encompass all junior manager roles plus additional permissions.
- Reduces the administrative burden when a role change occurs. No need to individually reassign permissions, just change the role.

## SELinux and SEAndroid

### SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)

#### Background
- Built on the Flask architecture, SELinux is designed to support mandatory access control policies across all processes in Linux.

#### Implementation
- Originally integrated as a Linux kernel patch, later re-implemented as a Linux Security Module (LSM).

### SEAndroid (Security-Enhanced Android)

#### Definition
- SEAndroid brings mandatory access control to Google's Android OS through an Android kernel that supports SELinux.

#### Technical Challenges
- The text hints at summarizing the main challenges and technical solutions in implementing SELinux on Android.

## Linux Security Modules (LSMs)

#### Purpose
- Linux Security Modules (LSMs) offer a framework allowing the Linux kernel to enforce diverse advanced access control approaches, including SELinux.

#### Technical Design
- They work by exposing kernel abstractions and operations to an LSM, enabling different modules to implement distinct approaches.

## Exercises

- The text includes various exercises designed to deepen understanding of Flask architecture, SELinux implementation, LSM design, and SEAndroid features.

## Conclusion

The text serves as an informative guide to understanding the intricacies of various access control mechanisms, with a specific focus on RBAC and MAC. It also sheds light on practical implementations such as SELinux and SEAndroid, offering a comprehensive perspective on modern access control schemes.
