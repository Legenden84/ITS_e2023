# 5.9 Relating subjects, processes, and protection domains

## Introduction

The section titled "Relating subjects, processes, and protection domains" discusses the intricate relationship between protection rings, domains, and subjects in computing, particularly in the context of access control and operating system (OS) architecture. The text elaborates on how access control works, refines the definitions of 'subjects' and 'domains', and discusses the implications of these definitions in different scenarios.

## Definitions

### Subjects and Domains

1. **Subject (S)**: A subject is defined as a tuple containing a process (P) that executes on its behalf and a domain (D). Mathematically, it is expressed as \( S = (P, D) \).

2. **Domain (D)**: A domain is also defined as a tuple but contains an execution ring (r) and a segment table (T) containing segment descriptors. Mathematically, it is expressed as \( D = (r, T) \).

These refined definitions result in a more detailed description of a subject as \( S = (P, r, T) \), which stands for \( S = (processID, ring-number, descriptor-seg-ptr) \).

## Observations

### Changes in Execution Context

1. **Change in Ring**: If a subject changes its execution ring, it effectively changes its domain, and consequently, the privileges it has at that point in time.

2. **Within the Same Ring**: Transferring control to a different segment but within the same ring does not change the domain or the subject.

3. **Access Bracket Entry Points**: These are like gatekeepers that enforce domain changes which are permissible.

4. **Virtual Address Translation**: The constraints on physical memory accessible to a domain are governed by these translation maps.

5. **Ordered Set of Protection Domains**: A system with \( n \) protection rings defines a strictly ordered set of \( n \) protection domains. Mathematically, \( D(i) = (i, T) \) for \( 0 \leq i \leq n - 1 \).

6. **C-lists**: These informally define the environment of a process. C-lists are equivalent to domains, allowing them to be substituted in the definition \( S = (P, D) \).

## Special Cases

### Unix Process Example

The text offers an example concerning Unix processes. When a Unix process invokes a root-owned `setuid` program, it keeps its Process Identifier (PID) but temporarily runs with a different eUID, altering its access privileges.

## Exercise Topics

1. **Ring changes vs. switching userid**: The section encourages the reader to explore how separating regular and administrative activities on different accounts compares to processes changing domains via ring changes.

2. **Platforms supporting more than two modes**: Another exercise encourages a discussion about how many CPU modes, privilege levels, or rings are supported by the ARMv7 processor architecture, OpenVMS, and OS/2. The text also asks whether any versions of Windows support more than two modes.

## Hardware and Software Considerations

### Unused CPU Modes

The text mentions that many computers possess hardware support for multiple CPU modes but run operating systems that use only two (supervisor and user). The reason cited is market pressures and hardware constraints. Specifically, OS vendors aim for maximum market share by deploying on a wide range of hardware, often leading to reduced software functionality.

## Summary

The section provides a comprehensive understanding of how subjects, processes, and protection domains interact and influence each other, particularly in the context of operating systems and access control mechanisms. It also brings into focus the practical considerations and challenges tied to the implementation of these concepts, specifically hardware and software limitations.
