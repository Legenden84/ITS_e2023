## Detailed Summary of CAPTCHAs vs. Automated Attacks

### Introduction
The text delves into the significance and mechanisms of CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart) as a countermeasure against automated attacks on web services. Such services, especially the free ones, are vulnerable to bots that can acquire email accounts in bulk for spamming or post malware on forums. CAPTCHAs present tasks that are simple for humans but challenging for bots to solve.

### Types of CAPTCHAs
CAPTCHAs exist in various formats, including:
- Character Recognition (CR)
- Audio Recognition (AUD)
- Image Recognition (IR)
- Cognitive Challenges like puzzles and games (COG)

### The Problem of Account Lock-Out
A typical way to mitigate brute-force or guessing attacks is to rate-limit the number of login attempts. However, this can result in account lock-out, inconveniencing legitimate users. Some attackers may aim to trigger this lock-out intentionally, especially during critical times like the end of an online auction.

### Pinkas-Sander Login Protocol
The text introduces the Pinkas-Sander Login Protocol as a more refined approach. This protocol mandates Automated Turing Tests (ATTs) only for a fraction `p` of login attempts and always when an unrecognized device is used.

#### How it Works
- Legitimate users typically have a set of recognized devices.
- The server initially recognizes a device when a user successfully logs in from it.
- Subsequently, an ATT is triggered when logging in from a new device or in a fraction `p` of cases where the wrong password is entered.

#### Technical Details
- Requiring an ATT only when the correct password is entered would inform attackers that they've guessed correctly, which is avoided.
- The decision to require an ATT is deterministic based on the submitted data, preventing attackers from bypassing it by simply retrying the same credentials.

### Efficacy Against Attackers
For an attacker expected to make many incorrect guesses, the Pinkas-Sander Protocol imposes a considerable "cost" in the form of ATTs:
- The attacker always has to solve an ATT for a correct guess from an unrecognized device.
- An ATT is also imposed a fraction `p` of the time for incorrect guesses.
- The attacker cannot know if a guess is correct until they solve the ATT, so abandoning an ATT might mean losing a correct guess.

### Attack Models
Two attack models are presented for analysis:
1. Automated program switches to a human to answer ATTs.
2. Automated program makes random guesses to answer ATTs, assuming an answer space of `n` elements.

### The Uncertain Future of CAPTCHAs
The efficacy of CAPTCHAs is in question for several reasons:
- Automated solvers have become sophisticated, making it harder to design CAPTCHAs that are both secure and user-friendly.
- CAPTCHAs can be outsourced maliciously or sent to "sweatshops" of human solvers.

### Google reCAPTCHA as a Case Study
- Introduced in 2014, it initially replaced traditional CAPTCHAs with a checkbox saying "I'm not a robot."
- A decision is made based on user behavior such as mouse movements and keystrokes.
- If inconclusive, a traditional CR or IR CAPTCHA is triggered.
- In 2017, even the checkbox was removed, indicating a trend towards more seamless user verification methods.
