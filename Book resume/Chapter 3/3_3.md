# Detailed Summary of 3.3 Account Recovery and Secret Questions

## Introduction

- Account recovery becomes essential as users often forget passwords.
- Usually, access to password-protected accounts is recovered, not the actual password.

## Recovery Passwords and Recovery Links

- **Common Method**: A temporary password or web page link is sent to the user's recovery email.
- **Authorization**: No need to enter the existing password for setting a new one; the temporary code or link serves as the authenticator.

## Complications with Primary Email Password

- **Issue**: Forgetting the primary email account password can complicate the recovery process.
- **Solutions**:
  - Registering a secondary email.
  - Pre-registering a phone number, where a one-time code is sent via SMS.

## Question-Based Recovery (Challenge Questions)

- **Concept**: During account registration, users answer a selected set of questions. These answers can be used for account recovery.
- **Downsides**:
  1. Time lapse between setting answers and recovery might affect memory.
  2. Answers may be non-unique or change over time.
  3. Users may register false answers and later forget them.

## Usability Aspects

- **Cued Recall**: Easier for people to answer questions based on long-term memory than to remember passwords.
- **Practical Issues**: Failure rates for challenge question-based recovery are often high due to the aforementioned downsides.

## Security Aspects

- **Weak Secrets**: Challenge questions usually offer weak security.
  - Answers are either non-unique or easily guessable.
  - Users create poor questions.
- **New Attack Vector**: If more easily guessed than the primary password, this adds a weak link in the security chain.

## Summary of Weaknesses

- **Inefficiency**: Answering multiple questions is less efficient and leads to higher rates of legitimate user rejection.
- **Security Risk**: Often stored in plaintext and are vulnerable to server break-ins.

## General Consensus

- **Deprecated**: The use of secret questions is best abandoned.
- **Alternative Measures**: Additional authenticators like a recovery email or SMS are suggested.

## Example: Password Reset Attack

- **Interleaving Attack**: A complex but feasible attack that exploits the weaknesses in password reset processes.
- **Requirements**: Attacker needs control over another website (`site-A`) and a way to get users to visit it.
- **Attack Flow**:
  1. Victim visits `site-A` and starts the registration process.
  2. Attacker initiates password reset for the victim at `site-B`.
  3. Questions or codes from `site-B` are forwarded to the victim under the guise of `site-A` registration.
  4. Attacker uses the victim's answers to reset the password at `site-B`.

- **Mitigations**: Attack fails if reset messages are sent to verified email addresses.

## Final Thoughts

- Recovery options that rely on secret questions or SMS are flawed.
- Stronger methods, such as sending reset links to verified email addresses, are recommended.
