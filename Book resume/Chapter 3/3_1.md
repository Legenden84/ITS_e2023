# Detailed Resume of Section 3.1: Password Authentication

## Overview

Section 3.1 dives deeply into the concept of password authentication, exploring its mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages, vulnerabilities, and alternatives. The section aims to provide a thorough understanding of how passwords function as a form of user authentication and the inherent limitations and risks associated with them.

## Basic Mechanism of Password Authentication

### Workflow

1. **User Account Identification**: Each user is assigned an account identified by either a character string username or a numeric user ID.
2. **Login Process**: Users enter their username and password to access their account.
3. **System Verification**: The entered credentials are transmitted to the system, which has stored information for comparison to authenticate the user.

### Security Caveats

- A correct password does **not guarantee** the identity of the user.
- Authentication is solely based on the entered string matching the expected password, which could also be a result of a lucky guess.

## Password Storage

### Storing Hashes vs Cleartext

- Passwords are **not stored in cleartext** but rather as hashes using a one-way hash function.
- This avoids risks associated with internal threats like system administrators or backup personnel.

### Pre-Computed Dictionary Attack

- Attackers may utilize pre-computed dictionaries containing hashed values of commonly used passwords.
- The attacker can then compare these with the hashes in the stolen password file to break the password.

## Attack Scopes

- **Targeted Attacks**: Focused on specific, pre-identified users.
- **Trawling Attacks**: Aim to break into any available account by trying multiple or all accounts.

## Approaches to Defeat Password Authentication

1. **Online Password Guessing**: Direct interaction with the legitimate server.
2. **Offline Password Guessing**: Attacker does not need to interact online for each guess.
3. **Password Capture Attacks**: Utilizes methods like keyloggers, shoulder-surfing, phishing, etc.
4. **Password Interface Bypass**: Exploits software vulnerabilities to avoid password interfaces entirely.
5. **Defeating Recovery Mechanisms**: Targeting the account recovery processes.

## Password Composition Policies and 'Strength'

- Encouragement for **complexity** in password composition, often involving combinations of lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.
- However, this so-called "strength" is **misleading** as it only protects against some forms of password guessing.

## Disadvantages of Passwords

1. Difficulty in memorization due to increased complexity.
2. The proliferation of multiple accounts exacerbates the challenge.
3. Vulnerability to various forms of attacks (e.g., offline guessing, password capture).
4. Restrictions in composition can be counterintuitive and confusing.

## Advantages of Passwords

1. Simplicity and universal understanding among users.
2. No additional hardware requirement.
3. Ease of password change or recovery.
4. Ability to delegate access, albeit with some security risks.

## Final Thoughts

Despite the apparent vulnerabilities and limitations, passwords remain a dominant means of authentication due to their simplicity, low cost, and the inertia of being the default authentication method for decades. However, the section suggests that to replace passwords, a new technology must not just be marginally better, but substantially better, considering factors like universal support and interoperability with existing systems.
