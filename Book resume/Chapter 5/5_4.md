# Detailed Resume of Text on Setuid bit and Effective Userid (eUID)

## Introduction

The text primarily discusses the concept of the "setuid" (Set User ID) bit, a specific permission bit in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The setuid bit has special implications for user privileges, file and process access. The text also touches upon the related ideas of "Effective User ID" (eUID), "Real User ID" (rUID), and "Saved User ID" (sUID), which are essential for managing permissions at the process level in Unix-like environments. Additional concepts like `setgid` (Set Group ID), various system calls, and example scenarios such as password changing in Unix and login procedures are also covered.

## SETUID Bit

### Definition and Purpose

- **Special Permission Bit**: Setuid is one of three "special" permission bits.
- **Owner's Privilege**: When the owner of a binary executable file sets this bit, any process that executes this file will have its effective user ID set to the owner of the file temporarily.
- **Access Extension**: This enables the process to access resources that it might not normally be able to, based on its own user ID.

### Use Cases

- **Security-Critical Programs**: Majorly used in programs that need to access critical system resources.
- **Target for Attackers**: The privilege model of setuid programs makes them an attractive target for attackers, especially if the file owner is root.

### Non-root Owners

- A setuid program can be owned by a regular user, allowing controlled access to that user’s files.

## Real User ID and Effective User ID

### Types of User IDs

- **Real User ID (rUID)**: Identifies the owner of the process.
- **Effective User ID (eUID)**: Used for checking resource access permissions.
- **Saved User ID (sUID)**: Helps in switching between rUID and eUID when needed.

### System Calls

- **getuid()**: Returns rUID.
- **geteuid()**: Returns eUID.
- **setuid(), seteuid(), setreuid()**: Allow setting the IDs.

### Principle P6 (LEAST-PRIVILEGE)

- eUID and rUID can be selectively switched to confine higher privileges only to code segments requiring them.

### Example: `su` command

- `su` (Substitute User Identity) changes the rUID, eUID, sUID to the user ID of the specified user.

## SETGID Permission Bit

- Analogous to setuid but works on a file's protection group.
- Uses rGID, eGID, sGID and has supporting system calls like `getgid()`, `getegid()`, `setgid()`.

## Practical Example: `passwd`

- When a Unix user wants to change their password, they use `passwd`.
- It has the setuid bit set, which allows it to write to the system password file. However, it can only modify the password entry corresponding to the UID of the calling process.

## Process Creation and Inheritance

- Processes in Unix are created by the `fork()` system call.
- The child process inherits user IDs (rUID, eUID, sUID) from the parent but gets a new Process ID (PID).

### Example: `login` Command

- It's a setuid program owned by root.
- Verifies username-password and sets process UID and GID based on the verified user’s password file entry.

## Display Notation for Setuid and Setgid

- When set, these bits are displayed in a 10-character notation.
- An "x" changes to "s", or a "-" changes to "S".
- Example: `-rwsr-xr-x` indicates a file executable by all, with setuid bit set.

## Exercises

- **sudo command**: Investigates the design and use of the `sudo` (Substitute User Do) command in Unix, focusing on its effects on rUID, eUID, sUID.
- **setuid and Printer Daemon**: Discusses how setuid can be useful for user access to a printer daemon and the general risks associated with setuid.

## Summary

The setuid bit is a powerful but risky feature. It allows processes to temporarily elevate or change their permissions, enabling them to perform tasks they otherwise couldn't. However, it can be a security risk if not managed carefully. The Unix system provides a complex but flexible way to manage these permissions at both the file and process level through the use of multiple user IDs and system calls.
