# Resume of Section 5.1: Memory protection, supervisor mode, and accountability

## Introduction
This section provides a comprehensive discussion on the evolution and architecture of memory protection mechanisms in computers, focusing on aspects like supervisor mode and accountability features. It outlines how the advancement from early single-program systems to time-sharing and multi-process environments has necessitated increasingly sophisticated security and isolation features.

## Early Computing Environment
- **Batch Processing**: Originated as a way to reduce idle CPU time by queuing programs together to be run one after another. This was cost-effective but inconvenient for users.
- **Time-sharing Systems (1960s)**: Allowed multiple users to share a single computer, giving the illusion of having individual access to the machine. Introduced the concept of organizing multiple running programs as 'processes'.

## Challenges in Multi-Process Environment
- **Isolation Issue**: Running more than one process simultaneously raised security issues.
  - *Example*: One process should not be allowed to write into another's memory space, whether maliciously or due to benign errors.

### Memory Protection Schemes
- **Initial Solutions**: The need for an isolation mechanism led to the introduction of early memory protection schemes.

#### Descriptor Register, Privileged Bit, and Supervisor
- **Descriptor Register**: It held a memory descriptor consisting of a base and bound pair that indicated the range of physical memory addresses accessible by a process.
- **Privileged Bit**: Only the supervisor program could load the descriptor register, thus controlling what memory addresses were available to a process.
- **Supervisor Mode**: Managed the descriptor register and ensured that user programs could not alter the privileged bit. Only the supervisor code runs with this bit set.

### Limitations
- **All-or-Nothing Approach**: This basic memory protection was too coarse-grained. It did not allow for specific memory-sharing scenarios.
  - *Example*: Suppose a service program `P` needed to be accessed by two user processes `U1` and `U2`. The basic descriptor-register-based protection was insufficient.

### Segment Addressing with Access Permissions
- **Memory Segment**: Introduced as a continuous block of words, offering a finer level of control.
- **Descriptor Base Register (DBR)**: Pointed to a table of segment descriptors for each process.
- **Access Control Bits**: The following permissions were associated with each memory segment:
  - `R`: Read Access
  - `W`: Write Access
  - `X`: Execute Access
  - `M`: Supervisor Mode Execution
  - `F`: Fault (traps all access to supervisor)

## Accountability and User Identification
- **UserIDs and Principals**: Each user account has a unique identifier, known as UserID (UID), which is the basis for granting access privileges to resources.
  - UID serves administrative, billing, and forensic purposes.
- **Authentication**: Basic mechanism involves username and password matching.
- **Process Identifier (PID)**: Used internally for OS scheduling.

## Roles and Least Privilege
- **Multiple Usernames for Different Roles**: Following the principle of 'Least Privilege', users may have multiple usernames for different roles (e.g., user and admin).
  - Switching between usernames changes the internal UIDs, effectively switching roles.
- **Shared Resource Access**: Recommended to use protection groups for sharing resources.

## Exercises and Further Topics
- The section poses questions regarding the design of memory protection and mentions that future sections will discuss concepts like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## Key Takeaways
- The evolution from batch processing to time-sharing systems introduced new challenges that necessitated the development of advanced memory protection mechanisms.
- Initial solutions like descriptor registers and privileged bits offered basic isolation but lacked fine-grained control.
- Advanced mechanisms like segment addressing provided more specific access permissions.
- User authentication and role management are crucial for accountability and access control.
