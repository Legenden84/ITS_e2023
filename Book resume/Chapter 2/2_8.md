# Comprehensive Summary: Certificates, Elliptic Curves, and Equivalent Keylengths

## Section 2.8 Overview

This section delves into the essential components of cryptography involving public-key certificates, the role of Certification Authorities (CAs), certificate revocation mechanisms, and the influence of key lengths. It also touches upon elliptic curve cryptography as an alternative to traditional methods.

## Certificates

### Definition and Components

- A public-key certificate is a data structure containing:
  1. **Subject Name**: The name of the entity the certificate represents.
  2. **Public Key**: Asserted to belong to the subject.
  3. **Digital Signature**: Made by a third-party, known as a Certification Authority (CA), that validates the binding between the subject and the public key.

### Purpose and Usage

- Certificates aim to bind a subject's identity with their public key reliably.
- Parties that rely on the certificate need to have an authentic copy of the CA’s public key to verify the CA’s signature and therefore the certificate's integrity.

## Certification Authorities (CAs)

### Role and Responsibilities

- The CA's role is vital for generating trustworthy certificates.
- Before signing a certificate, the CA is expected to perform due diligence to verify:
  1. The identity of the subject.
  2. The subject's association with the public key.

### Trust Propagation

- Trust in one key extends to many keys, as the CA's signature on a certificate extends trust to that certificate's public key.

## Certificate Revocation

### Components for Revocation

- Certificates contain additional fields like:
  1. Serial Number: To uniquely identify the certificate.
  2. Expiry Date: Indicating its valid duration.
  3. Revocation Information: Details on how to check if the certificate has been revoked.

### Why and How

- Revocation can happen before the expiry date for various reasons such as a compromised private key or change in the subject’s role.
- Revocation information helps relying parties check the current status of a certificate's validity.

## NIST-Recommended Key Lengths

### Security Strength

- As of November 2015, NIST recommended at least 112 bits of "security strength" for public U.S. government use.
- "Strength" is not just the raw bitlength but an estimate of security based on the best-known attacks.

### Comparisons Between Algorithms

- Key lengths need to be comparable in strength when multiple algorithms are used together to avoid weak links.

## Elliptic Curve Public-Key Systems (ECC)

### Definition and Classification

- ECC is an alternative to integer factorization cryptography (IFC) like RSA, and finite field cryptography (FFC) like Diffie-Hellman.
- ECC involves operations over sets defined by points on an elliptic curve.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**:
  1. Computational efficiency.
  2. Storage efficiency due to smaller key sizes.
- **Disadvantages**:
  1. More complex mathematics.
  2. Signature verification is more computationally intensive than in RSA.
