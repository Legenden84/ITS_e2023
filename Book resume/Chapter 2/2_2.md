### Comprehensive Summary: 2.2 Symmetric-key Encryption and Decryption

#### Introduction and Types of Algorithms
- **Two Categories**: The section introduces two primary categories of encryption algorithmsâ€”Symmetric-Key Encryption and Asymmetric-Key Encryption.
- **Symmetric-Key Encryption**: In this type, the encryption and decryption keys are the same, making it more straightforward but also posing unique challenges in key management.

#### Vernam Cipher and One-Time Pads
- **Stream Cipher**: Vernam cipher is showcased as an example of a stream cipher where encryption occurs one bit at a time.
- **Exclusive-OR (XOR) Operation**: It utilizes bitwise XOR for both encryption and decryption.
- **One-Time Pad**: A specialized form of the Vernam cipher where the key is as long as the message and used only once.
- **Theoretical Security**: It's theoretically unbreakable if the key is truly random and never reused.
- **Practical Limitations**: Difficulties in secure key distribution and the inefficiency of using long, single-use keys make it less practical for widespread use.

#### Encryption Security and Integrity
- **Integrity Concerns**: One-time pads, while secure for confidentiality, do not inherently offer integrity, allowing data to be tampered with without detection.
- **Cryptographic Best Practices**: Emphasizes the need for algorithms to be both designed by experts and have undergone significant scrutiny.

#### Cipher Attacks in Practice
- **Information-Theoretic vs Computational Security**: One-time pads are information-theoretically secure, whereas many ciphers offer only computational security.
- **Potential Weaknesses**: Discusses how ciphers could be vulnerable to algorithmic flaws, small key spaces, or other attacks that exploit limitations in computational resources.

#### Stream Ciphers in Depth
- **Working Mechanism**: A continuous stream of cipher bits, known as a keystream, is generated and XOR'd onto the plaintext bits for encryption.
- **Flexibility**: They are well-suited for encrypting data streams where the length is not predetermined, such as real-time communication.

#### Block Ciphers Explained
- **Processing in Chunks**: Unlike stream ciphers, block ciphers work on fixed-length blocks of data.
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Currently the most widely used block cipher, developed after rigorous evaluation and testing.

#### Padding and Blocklength
- **Incomplete Blocks**: If a plaintext block doesn't meet the required size, it is padded with filler characters.
- **Padding Rule**: Commonly, a 1-bit is appended, followed by as many 0-bits as needed to complete the block.

#### Modes of Operation
- **ECB (Electronic Code Book)**: The simplest mode where each block is encrypted independently, leading to patterns in the ciphertext.
- **CBC (Cipher-Block Chaining) and CTR (Counter) Modes**: More advanced modes that depend on adjacent blocks, making the encryption more secure.

#### Message Integrity and Expansion
- **Authentication Tags**: Often used to assure message integrity.
- **Message Expansion**: The need for such tags, and possibly other parameters, may result in the ciphertext being larger than the plaintext.
