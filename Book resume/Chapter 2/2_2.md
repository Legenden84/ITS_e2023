# Summary of 2.2 Symmetric-key encryption and decryption

## Introduction
The text elaborates on symmetric-key encryption, one of two categories of cryptographic algorithmsâ€”the other being asymmetric encryption. In symmetric-key encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The text introduces various types of symmetric ciphers, including stream ciphers and block ciphers, and explores their properties, limitations, and common modes of operation.

## Symmetric-Key Encryption
Symmetric-key encryption uses the same key for both the encryption and decryption processes. This is mathematically represented by `k = k0` in equation (2.1).

### Example: Vernam Cipher
- **Concept**: The Vernam cipher is a stream cipher that encrypts plaintext one bit at a time.
- **Key Requirement**: It requires a key that is as long as the plaintext.
- **Algorithm**: Encryption and decryption are performed using bitwise exclusive-OR (XOR) operations.
- **One-Time Pad**: If the key is randomly chosen and never reused, this cipher is known as a one-time pad, which offers theoretically unbreakable encryption.

#### Proof Sketch for Unbreakability of One-Time Pad
Any given ciphertext could originate from any possible plaintext when a unique key is used for each encryption, making it impossible for an attacker to determine the original message.

### Limitations of One-Time Pads
- **Key Management**: Difficult to distribute and manage keys that are as long as the message.
- **Lack of Integrity**: Encryption alone does not guarantee the integrity of the data, as demonstrated by a theoretical scenario involving salary manipulation.

## Cipher Attacks in Practice
- **Types of Security**: One-time pad offers information-theoretic security, while most ciphers offer only computational security.
- **Weaknesses**: Ciphers can fail due to algorithmic flaws, small key spaces, or keys being compromised.

## Types of Symmetric Ciphers

### Stream Ciphers
- **Basic Operation**: Generate a keystream that is simply XOR'd onto plaintext bits for encryption and decryption.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for real-time encryption of data streams, such as user-typed characters.

### Block Ciphers
- **Basic Operation**: Processes plaintext in fixed-size blocks, applying a fixed transformation dependent on the key.
- **Blocklength and Key Size**: Main properties include block size in bits (blocklength) and key size in bits (keylength).
- **Padding**: If the last block is smaller than the block size, it's padded with filler characters.

#### Example: AES Block Cipher
- **Popular Algorithm**: Most widely used block cipher today.
- **Creation**: Created by KU Leuven researchers and standardized by NIST.

## Message Expansion
Symmetric ciphers are generally length-preserving but may require additional space for authentication tags or other parameters for integrity protection.

## Modes of Operation
- **ECB**: Electronic Codebook mode processes each block independently, leading to pattern leakage.
- **CBC and CTR**: Cipher-Block Chaining and Counter modes make encryption context-sensitive, overcoming the limitations of ECB.

## Encryption in Practice
- Symmetric-key encryption is usually combined with integrity mechanisms like Message Authentication Codes (MACs).
