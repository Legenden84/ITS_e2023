### Resume of Chapter 2: Cryptographic Building Blocks

- **Main Topic**: Introduction to foundational cryptographic mechanisms for computer security.
- **Key Mechanisms Discussed**:
  - Symmetric-key encryption
  - Public-key encryption
  - Digital signatures
  - Hash functions
  - Message authentication codes
- **Additional Content**:
  - Brief mention of digital certificates, with detailed discussion in Chapter 8.
  - Contextual mathematical and crypto background deferred to later chapters.
- **Analogy**:
  - Cryptography is to computer security as electrical wiring is to house-building.
- **Audience Focus**:
  - Aimed at helping software developers properly use cryptographic toolkits rather than build or design them.
- **Key Advice**:
  - Do not design your own cryptographic protocols or algorithms.
