### Resume of Section 2.1: Encryption and Decryption (Generic Concepts)

- **What are Algorithms**: Defined as a series of steps, often implemented in hardware or software.

- **Role of Encryption and Decryption**: Fundamental for data confidentiality, especially in distributed systems. They are parameterized by cryptographic keys.

- **Plaintext vs. Ciphertext**:
  - Encryption converts plaintext to ciphertext.
  - Decryption reverses this process.
  - Keys control access to plaintext.

- **Generic Notation**:
  - \( m \) for plaintext
  - \( c \) for ciphertext
  - \( E_k, D_{k'} \) for encryption and decryption algorithms

- **Exercise on Caesar Cipher**:
  - Describes a simple substitution encryption.

- **Cryptosystem Components**:
  - Sets \( P \), \( C \), \( K \) for plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys respectively.
  - Mappings \( E \) and \( D \) for encryption and decryption.

- **Exhaustive Key Search**:
  - Infeasibility of key recovery without access to the key.
  - Example with DES's 56-bit key length.

- **Cipher Attack Models**:
  - Ciphertext-only Attack
  - Known-plaintext Attack
  - Chosen-plaintext Attack
  - Chosen-ciphertext Attack

- **Types of Adversaries**:
  - Passive: Observes and records.
  - Active: Alters or injects data.
