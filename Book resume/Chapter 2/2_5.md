# Detailed Summary: 2.5 Cryptographic Hash Functions

## Introduction
Cryptographic hash functions play a crucial role in information security. They take any binary input (like a message or file) and generate a fixed-length hash. These hashes serve as a unique identifier for the data, with any change in the input causing drastic changes in the hash.

## Key Properties
Three properties are often required for a cryptographic hash function (`H`):
- **H1 (One-Way Property/Preimage Resistance)**: Given a hash value, it should be difficult to find the original input.
- **H2 (Second-Preimage Resistance)**: Given an input, it should be difficult to find a different input with the same hash.
- **H3 (Collision Resistance)**: It should be difficult to find two different inputs with the same hash.

## Computational Security
The concept of "infeasibility" in these properties refers to computational infeasibility, implying the computational cost to break the hash should be prohibitively high.

## Design of Hash Functions
Creating hash functions that meet these criteria is a specialized field. Developers should rely on the expertise of cryptographic experts for suitable hash functions.

## Application Categories

### One-Way Hash Functions
Used where "one-wayness" is critical like in password hashing. Usually satisfies both H1 and H2 properties.

### Collision-Resistant Hash Functions
Important for applications where finding two identical hashes from different inputs could be detrimental. H3 is the most robust property, often implying H1 and H2.

## Practical Applications
- **Data Integrity Check**: Hashes of trusted files are generated and stored. Later, these hashes are compared before file execution to ensure integrity.
- **Password Verification**: Hashes are used instead of plaintext passwords for secure authentication.

## Common Hash Functions
- SHA-3, SHA-2, SHA-1, and MD5 are common algorithms, with newer ones being more secure.

## Birthday Paradox in Security
The Birthday Paradox explains why collision attacks (H3) can be more easily achieved than one might intuitively expect. It has implications in hash collision vulnerability.

## Digital Signatures
Hash functions are often used in digital signature schemes where the hash of the message is signed instead of the message itself. This requires collision-resistant (H3) hash functions.

## Exercises
- Discuss why CRC algorithms are not suitable as cryptographic hashes.
- Consider when H3 is actually necessary for data integrity and password verification.
- Discuss the pros and cons of hashing passwords at the client end.
- Different attacks stopped by H2 and H3 in digital signatures.
- Discuss Merkle hash trees and their role in BitTorrent.
- Consider the role of one-way hash functions in biometric authentication.
