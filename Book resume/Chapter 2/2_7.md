### Detailed Summary of 2.7 Authenticated Encryption and Further Modes of Operation

#### Overview
The section discusses Authenticated Encryption (AE) that combines encryption with integrity checks, going beyond Message Authentication Codes (MACs). It also looks at different symmetric-key cipher modes.

#### Authenticated Encryption (AE)
- **Definition**: AE ensures both encryption and data origin authentication. This helps in detecting unauthorized manipulations like message forgery or alteration.

- **Generic Composition**: One straightforward method is to use a separate encryption algorithm along with a separate MAC algorithm. This is termed as 'generic composition'.

- **Integrated AE Algorithms**: These are specialized algorithms designed to safely use a single key for both encryption and authentication. This is technically more preferable than using separate keys for different cryptographic functions.

#### AE with Associated Data (AEAD)
- **Real-World Scenario**: Often there is a need to encrypt the actual message while also wanting to ensure the integrity of additional data (like header fields) that should not be encrypted.

- **AEAD Algorithms**: These algorithms, such as CCM (Counter Mode with CBC-MAC), are designed to accommodate this requirement by taking into account the additional or 'associated' data.

#### Modes of Operation
- **CCM Mode**: Combines Counter (CTR) mode for encryption and CBC-MAC for authentication. Most commonly uses AES as the underlying block cipher.

- **ChaCha20 and Poly1305**: Created by Dan Bernstein, these are designed for high security and better performance, especially where AES hardware support is lacking. Poly1305 uses a 128-bit key, and for AEAD, ChaCha20 is often paired with Poly1305.

#### Technical Details
- **CCM in Practice**: Requires agreement on several application-specific details like input formatting and sometimes shortening the MAC tag.

- **Common Ciphers and Specs**: A table enumerates well-known symmetric-key algorithms like AES, ChaCha20, Poly1305, along with their block lengths, key lengths, and other details.

#### Exercises and Questions
- **Implementation Choices**: Questions are raised about the security of various methods of implementing AE through serial combinations of encryption and MAC algorithms.

- **Cipher Specs**: Lists out details of common ciphers and AEAD algorithms, including block and key lengths, modes of operation, and other specifics.

#### Table 2.2
