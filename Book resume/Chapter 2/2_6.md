### Extended Summary of 2.6 Message Authentication (Data Origin Authentication)

#### Core Concepts
Message authentication aims to provide two essential services:
1. **Data Integrity**: It assures that the data hasn't been tampered with during transmission.
2. **Data Origin Authentication**: It verifies the identity of the party who originated the data.

These services are facilitated through a unique data value known as the Message Authentication Code (MAC).

#### Technical Details
- The MAC is computed using a special hash function (MAC function) and a secret key shared between the sender and receiver.
- This hash function is unique because its output relies on both the input message and a secret number (the shared key).

#### MAC Generation and Verification
1. Alice wants to send a message to Bob.
2. Alice computes a MAC tag `t = Mk(m)`, where `Mk` is the MAC algorithm and `m` is the message.
3. Alice sends `(m, t)` to Bob.
4. Bob receives `(m0, t0)` and uses his own copy of the shared key to compute `Mk(m0)`.
5. Bob verifies that his computed MAC matches the received `t0`.

#### Security Assumptions
- The security of this scheme lies in the assumption that only the data originator has access to the shared secret key.
- Any party with the key can verify the tag, leading to the assumption that the message is authentic.

#### Limitations of MAC
- MAC does not provide non-repudiation. In a dispute, if Alice denies being the originator, a third party cannot definitively determine the truth.

#### Public-Key Signatures
- As a more advanced alternative, public-key signatures provide both data origin authentication and non-repudiation, unlike MACs.

#### MAC Algorithm Examples
- **CMAC**: Uses block ciphers for MAC generation.
- **HMAC**: A general construction that employs generic hash functions like SHA-1, SHA-2, or SHA-3.
- **Poly1305-AES-MAC** and **AEAD combinations**: Other specialized MAC algorithms.

#### CBC-MAC
- A MAC algorithm derived from the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of block ciphers.
- It essentially treats data as blocks and runs these blocks through the CBC mode of operation, using the final ciphertext block as the MAC tag.

#### Advanced Considerations
- Using hash functions to create MACs may seem simple but is fraught with security risks.
- Truncated MACs: While they save bandwidth, they might compromise security.

#### Exercises
- The section provides several exercises for better understanding MAC creation, its limitations, and also the principles behind data integrity.
  - For example, the exercises explore why simple methods of creating MACs from hash functions are risky.
  - Questions are also raised about the implications of truncating the output of MAC algorithms.

#### Data Integrity and Data Origin Authentication
- The section closes by posing existential questions about the relationship between Data Integrity and Data Origin Authentication. Specifically, it questions whether one can exist without the other.
