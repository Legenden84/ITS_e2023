### Detailed Summary of Section 2.9: End Notes and Further Reading

#### Recommended Books and Classic Treatments

- **Historical Accounts**: For a comprehensive history of cryptography, Kahn's work is a classic reference, while Singh provides a shorter, yet captivating narrative. Welchman's book offers an insider perspective on WWII British code-breaking at Bletchley Park, including insights on human errors in key management.

- **Academic Introductions**: Diffie and Hellman introduced the concept of public-key cryptography and the Diffie-Hellman key agreement. RSA encryption and signatures are credited to Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman.

- **RSA Attacks**: Boneh provides detailed surveys on attacks on RSA and highlights the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical implementations of public-key algorithms.

- **Applied Cryptography**: For a broad foundation, Menezes offers extensive content. It even delves into classical "toy ciphers" and how basic attacks can undermine them, offering clarity on why the one-time pad fails if keys are reused.

#### Practical Cryptography & Elliptic Curve Cryptography

- **Practical Cryptography**: Ferguson's book is recommended for those looking for practical insights into cryptography.

- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: Menezes' work serves as a comprehensive guide for ECC, explaining its mathematical foundations and applications.

#### Standards and Algorithms

- **Triple-DES**: For its status as of 2017, NIST provides documentation. Newer alternatives are generally favored over triple-DES now.

- **Block Cipher Constructions**: NIST 800-38B and RFC 4493 cover details on CMAC block cipher construction, an improvement on CBC-MAC.

- **Stream Ciphers**: RFC 7539 discusses the ChaCha20 stream cipher and Poly1305 MAC, including their advantages over AES. The RC4 stream cipher is now prohibited by TLS.

- **HMAC**: The use of HMAC with MD5 (HMAC-MD5) is now discouraged, especially for signature applications.

- **Digital Signatures**: FIPS 186-4 specifies DSA and its elliptic curve variant, ECDSA. The section also explains the difference between digital signatures with and without message recovery.

#### Hash Functions and AEAD

- **Hash Functions**: Preneel undertook the first systematic study of cryptographic hash functions. Menezes' Chapter 9 provides an early overview.

- **Authenticated Encryption**: Rogaway formalized AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data), and NIST-specified modes include CCM and GCM.

#### Legal and Patent Issues

- **Patent Issues**: The OCB mode of Rogaway is faster than both CCM and GCM but has faced patent entanglement issues that have impacted its adoption.

#### NIST Recommendations

- **Recommended Keylengths**: The recommended keylength pairings are derived from NIST guidelines.

This section serves as a rich resource guide, offering literature recommendations and crucial references for further reading and deeper understanding in various facets of cryptography.
