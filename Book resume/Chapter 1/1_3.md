## 1.3 Risk, Risk Assessment, and Modeling Expected Losses

### Definitions and Approaches
- **Risk**: Defined as the expected loss from harmful future events concerning specific assets and over a fixed period.
- **Risk Assessment**: Analyzing threat agents, attack probabilities, and expected losses to estimate risk.

### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Risk Assessment
- **Quantitative**: Aims to compute numerical risk estimates, which is challenging in practice.
- **Qualitative**: Compares risks relative to each other for prioritizing defensive budget across assets.

### Risk Equations
- **R = T · V · C**
  - **T**: Threat information (probability of threats)
  - **V**: Vulnerabilities
  - **C**: Asset value or impact cost
- **ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy) = n ∑ i=1 Fi · Ci**
  - **Fi**: Estimated annualized frequency of event type `i`
  - **Ci**: Average loss expected per occurrence of event type `i`

### Key Questions in Risk Assessment
1. What assets are most valuable?
2. What system vulnerabilities exist?
3. What are the relevant threat agents and attack vectors?
4. What are the estimated attack probabilities or frequencies?

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Weighs the cost of deploying security mechanisms against the anticipated benefits.
- **Example**: If password expiration reduces losses by $1000/month but incurs a $2500/month help-desk cost, it's not cost-effective.

### Challenges in Risk Assessment
- Lack of historical data for failure probabilities.
- Rapid technology evolution and incomplete knowledge of vulnerabilities.
- Intangible assets like reputation are hard to quantify.

### Risk Management vs. Mitigation
- **Risk Management**: Combines technical and business activities for an informed response.
- Options include:
  - Technical or procedural countermeasures
  - Transferring risk through insurance
  - Accepting the risk
  - Eliminating the risk by decommissioning the system
