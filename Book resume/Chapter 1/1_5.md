# 1.5 Threat Modeling: Diagrams, Trees, Lists and STRIDE

A threat model identifies threats, threat agents, and attack vectors that the target system considers in scope to defend against—known from the past, or anticipated. Those considered out of scope should be explicitly recorded as such. Threat modeling takes into account adversary modeling (Section 1.4), and should identify and consider all assumptions made about the target system, environment, and attackers. Various approaches to threat modeling exist, as discussed in the subsections below.

## 1.5.1 Diagram-Driven Threat Modeling

A visual approach to threat modeling begins by drawing an architectural representation of the system. This includes the components and all communication links used for data flows. System gateways where controls restrict or filter communications are also identified. Trust domains, such as authenticated areas or filtered paths, are marked in the diagram. This technique aims to:

- Focus on each component, link, and domain
- Identify possible security weaknesses
- Trace data and user workflows
- Revisit the diagram to refine and update it

The diagram serves as a starting point to encourage semi-structured brainstorming and identify possible threats and attack vectors.

## 1.5.2 Attack Trees for Threat Modeling

Attack trees are another useful tool for threat modeling. They:

- Start with an overall attack goal at the root
- Break out alternative ways to reach the parent’s goal in lower nodes
- Annotate nodes with details like feasibility or cost
- Are used iteratively, being updated as new attacks are identified

The result is an extensive list of possible attacks, which can then be assessed.

## 1.5.3 Other Threat Modeling Approaches: Checklists and STRIDE

### ATTACK/THREAT CHECKLISTS

Checklists are a more structured approach, drawing from larger community experiences. They can be thorough but may lack customization for a specific environment.

### STRIDE

STRIDE stands for:

- **Spoofing**: attempts to impersonate a thing (e.g., website), or an entity (e.g., user)
- **Tampering**: unauthorized altering, e.g., of code, stored data, transmitted packets
- **Repudiation**: denying responsibility for past actions
- **Information disclosure**: unauthorized release of data
- **Denial of service**: impacting availability or quality of services
- **Escalation of privilege**: gaining unauthorized access levels

STRIDE serves to stimulate open-ended thought and guide the identification of threats to architectural components.
