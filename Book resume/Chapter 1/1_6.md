#### 1.6 Model-reality gaps and real-world outcomes

- **Introduction**
  - Discussion on the difficulties of threat modeling and its importance in defining security policies.

- **1.6.1 Threat modeling and model-reality gaps**
  - Threat modeling is tricky and involves many variables like trust and the quality of the model itself.
  - The quality of a threat model depends on how accurately it represents the system it's designed to protect.
  - Model-reality gaps often arise from invalid assumptions and focusing on the wrong threats.

- **Quality of a Threat Model**
  - High-level models often miss technical details, leading to security vulnerabilities.

- **Example Cases**
  - Various examples illustrating how security models can fail, such as hotel safes, online trading fraud, and one-time passwords.

- **1.6.2 Tying security policy back to real outcomes and security analysis**
  - Security mechanisms and policies must align to achieve real-world security.
  - Three potential outcomes: failure to meet goals, success in preventing policy violations, and partial success with loopholes.

- **Security Analysis and Key Questions**
  - Steps for iterative security design and key questions to consider like what assets are valuable and what attacks put them at risk.

- **Testing is Necessarily Incomplete**
  - Security testing can only go so far in proving a system is secure.

- **Security is Unobservable**
  - Security can't be directly observed or tested thoroughly.

- **Assurance is Difficult, Partial**
  - Practical approaches to increasing security assurance involve iterative improvement and learning from past mistakes.
