# Extended Summary of 1.6 Model-reality gaps and real-world outcomes

## 1.6.1 Threat Modeling and Model-Reality Gaps

### Introduction and Example

- Threat modeling is a complex task with a real-world example presented to highlight its intricacies.
- Example: A hotel safebox scenario brings into focus the complexities involved. The question arises: Is your money secure?

### Quality of a Threat Model

- The accuracy of a threat model is contingent on how well it represents the real system and its operating environment.
- A model-reality gap can lead to a false sense of security, often arising due to abstraction or two main modeling errors:
    1. Invalid Assumptions: Often involving misplaced trust.
    2. Wrong Focus on Threats: Not adapting to technological changes can result in this error.

### Model Assumptions and Focusing on the Wrong Threats

- Model assumptions can fail due to incomplete or incorrect information, oversimplification, or abstraction loss.
- Implicit assumptions are problematic as they are rarely scrutinized.
- Focusing on less probable or impactful threats wastes effort and overlooks the significant threats.

### The Ideal Threat Model

- An ideal threat model combines practical experience and analytical reasoning.
- The question "What's your threat model?" is crucial for effective security analysis.

### Examples of Real-world Threat Model Failures

1. Online Trading Fraud: Disabling direct cash withdrawal didn't prevent manipulation of stock prices.
2. Phishing One-time Passwords: Fraudulent websites tricked users into revealing multiple one-time passwords.
3. Bypassing Perimeter Defenses: Local installation of software or direct USB connections bypass corporate firewalls.

### Debriefing

- Incorrect assumptions and/or threat models were the failure points in the above examples.
- Failing to validate assumptions or not considering unaccounted threats can render even a logically sound model ineffective.

### Iterative Process

- Threat modeling is an evolving, iterative process.
- Static threat models become obsolete as environments and technologies change.

## 1.6.2 Tying Security Policy Back to Real Outcomes and Security Analysis

### Outcome Scenarios

1. Defenses fail to support policy: Security goal not met.
2. Defenses and policy align: The system is 'secure.'
3. Policy is incomplete: Simple, unanticipated attacks can still succeed.

### Security Analysis and Key Questions

- The iterative design and analysis process identifies valuable assets and forms of protection.
- Key questions:
    1. What assets are valuable?
    2. What attacks put them at risk?
    3. How to manage potentially damaging actions?

### Testing Limitations

- Security testing is necessarily incomplete and is limited to well-defined scopes.
- Assurance is incomplete, traditional testing methods can't prove the absence of flaws.

### Security is Unobservable

- Security testing also aims to confirm the absence of exploitable flaws, a 'negative goal.'
- Security properties are difficult to predict, measure, or observe.

### Assurance is Difficult and Partial

- 100% guarantees are not possible.
- Assurance comes from sound design practices, testing for common flaws, formal modeling, ad hoc analysis, and experience.
- Lessons often come from attacks and mistakes, contributing to iterative improvement.
