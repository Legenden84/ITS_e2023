### 1.8 Why Computer Security is Hard - Summary

Computer security continues to be a challenging field despite advancements in technology. The text outlines various factors that contribute to the complexity of ensuring security in computer systems. Here are some key points:

1. **Intelligent Adversary**: Security faces an ever-learning and adaptive opponent, often driven by economic motives.
2. **No Rulebook**: Attackers don't follow rules, giving them an edge over defenders who follow protocols.
3. **Asymmetry**: Defenders have to protect all potential attack points, while attackers only need to find one vulnerability.
4. **Scale**: The Internet allows large-scale attacks at low cost.
5. **Connectivity**: The increase in Internet devices facilitates attacks from distant locations.
6. **Pace of Tech Evolution**: Rapid innovation creates a moving target for security.
7. **Complexity**: Growing software complexity increases the number of potential vulnerabilities.
8. **Developer Training**: Lack of security training among developers exacerbates the problem.
9. **Interoperability**: Compatibility requirements often delay security upgrades.
10. **Market Forces**: Economic considerations often trump security.
11. **Features over Security**: There's a market preference for features rather than security.
12. **Low Cost over Quality**: Cheap but insecure products often win out.
13. **Lack of Context**: Users lack real-world cues to guide behavior online.
14. **Managing Secrets**: The secure management of passwords and encryption keys is challenging.
15. **Human Factors**: Users often bypass inconvenient security features.
16. **Error-Inducing Design**: Poorly designed security features can induce errors.
17. **Non-Expert Users**: The general population lacks specialized security training.
18. **Retrofitted Security**: Security was not a foundational design element in many systems.
19. **New Exposures**: Security measures can sometimes introduce new vulnerabilities.
20. **Government Obstacles**: Policy can hinder best security practices.

Despite these challenges, the field offers great opportunities for innovation and employment. The more society understands about security, the safer it can make computing environments, contributing to overall social well-being.
