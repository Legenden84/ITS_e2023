#### 1.7 Summary of Design Principles for Computer Security

The text provides an in-depth look at design principles that system designers should consider for building secure computer-based systems. These principles are not part of a complete checklist but act as general guidelines:

1. **P1 Simplicity-and-Necessity**: Keep design simple and remove unnecessary components to minimize attack surfaces.
2. **P2 Safe-Defaults**: Use safe default settings like deny-by-default in access control.
3. **P3 Open-Design**: Avoid security through obscurity and encourage open review.
4. **P4 Complete-Mediation**: Verify authority before granting access to objects.
5. **P5 Isolated-Compartments**: Compartmentalize system components for damage control and escalation prevention.
6. **P6 Least-Privilege**: Grant only the necessary privileges needed for a task.
7. **P7 Modular-Design**: Use fine-grained, object-oriented designs to segregate privileges.
8. **P8 Small-Trusted-Bases**: Keep the trusted codebase small for concentrated security analysis.
9. **P9 Time-Tested-Tools**: Use well-established security tools rather than creating your own.
10. **P10 Least-Surprise**: Align the design with users' expectations to avoid mistakes.
11. **P11 User-Buy-In**: Make security mechanisms user-friendly to encourage usage.
12. **P12 Sufficient-Work-Factor**: Tune mechanisms to exceed the effort required for a potential breach.
13. **P13 Defense-In-Depth**: Use multi-layered security strategies.
14. **P14 Evidence-Production**: Record system activities for accountability and forensics.
15. **P15 Datatype-Validation**: Validate all received data.
16. **P16 Remnant-Removal**: Remove traces of sensitive data after a session.
17. **P17 Trust-Anchor-Justification**: Justify the base points of assumed trust.
18. **P18 Independent-Confirmation**: Cross-check code or data for increased confidence.
19. **P19 Request-Response-Integrity**: Ensure responses match requests in protocols.
20. **P20 Reluctant-Allocation**: Be cautious in allocating resources to unauthenticated agents.

Higher-level principles include:

- **HP1 Security-by-Design**: Incorporate security from the initial design stage.
- **HP2 Design-for-Evolution**: Design for future changes and updates in security mechanisms.
