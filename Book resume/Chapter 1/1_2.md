## 1.2 Computer Security Policies and Attacks

### Ambiguity in Security
The text argues that terms like "This computer is secure" are often ambiguous and subject to individual interpretation. To combat this, the field requires precise definitions and specialized terminology.

### Assets and Policy
Security aims to protect assets, which could range from information to hardware. Security policies formally outline what is allowed and what isn't, ideally providing a framework for enforcing these rules.

### Theory vs. Practice
In theory, a security policy should precisely define every system state as either secure or non-secure. In practice, these policies are often less rigorous, but they still serve as the basis against which security is measured.

### Attacks and Agents
An "attack" refers to any deliberate action aimed at causing a security violation. These attacks exploit "vulnerabilities" in the system, such as design or implementation flaws. The entity behind the attack is termed an "adversary" or "attacker."

### Threats
A "threat" refers to any situation or entity that could potentially cause harm or security violations. Threats become credible when there's both capability and intent to harm. Security aims to mitigate these threats primarily by eliminating vulnerabilities.

### Controls
Controls and countermeasures are put in place to enforce security policies, detect violations, and limit damage. These can range from operational processes to specialized security devices and software techniques.

### Example
The text gives a house security policy as an analogy. In this example, the unlocked back door represents a vulnerability, a stranger entering the house and removing an object is an attacker carrying out an attack, and the security policy would state that no one should enter unaccompanied.

The section highlights the importance of defining what we mean by "secure" and how policy, in theory and practice, helps us gauge and enforce security measures.
