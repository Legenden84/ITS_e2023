# 1.4 Adversary Modeling and Security Analysis

An important part of any computer security analysis is building out an adversary model, including identifying which adversary classes a target system aims to defend against—a lone gunman on foot calls for different defenses than a battalion of tanks supported by a squadron of fighter planes.

## Adversary Attributes

Attributes of an adversary to be considered include:

* **Objectives**—these often suggest target assets requiring special protection.
* **Methods**—e.g., the anticipated attack techniques, or types of attacks.
* **Capabilities**—computing resources (CPU, storage, bandwidth), skills, knowledge, personnel, opportunity (e.g., physical access to target machines).
* **Funding Level**—this influences attacker determination, methods, and capabilities.
* **Outsider vs. Insider**—an attack launched without any prior special access to the target network is an outsider attack. In contrast, insiders and insider attacks originate from parties having some starting advantage, e.g., employees with physical access or network credentials as legitimate users.

### Named Groups of Adversaries

| Index | Group                                |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| 1     | Foreign intelligence                 |
| 2     | Cyber-terrorists                     |
| 3     | Industrial espionage agents          |
| 4     | Organized crime groups               |
| 5     | Lesser criminals and crackers†       |
| 6     | Malicious insiders                   |
| 7     | Non-malicious employees              |

† The popular media uses the term hackers, which others use for computer system experts knowledgeable about low-level details.

## Schemas

Various schemas are used in modeling adversaries. A categorical schema classifies adversaries into named groups, as given in the above table. A capability-level schema groups generic adversaries based on a combination of capability (opportunity and resources) and intent (motivation), say from Level 1 to 4 (weakest to strongest).

## Security Evaluations and Penetration Testing

Some government departments and other organizations may require that prior to purchase or deployment, products be certified through a formal security evaluation process. This involves a third-party lab reviewing, at considerable cost and time, the final form of a product or system, to verify conformance with detailed evaluation criteria as specified in relevant standards.

## Security Analysis

Security analysis of a system or product is an open-ended activity that aims to identify vulnerabilities (primarily design-related) and overlooked threats; where weaknesses are found, ways to improve defenses are then considered.

## Security Models

Security analysis often involves building an abstract security model, which relates system components to parts of the security policy to be enforced; the model may then be explored to increase confidence that security requirements are met.
