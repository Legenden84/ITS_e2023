### 1.1 Fundamental Goals of Computer Security - Summary

#### Definition:
Computer security is described as a multidisciplinary practice aimed at protecting computer-related assets from unauthorized actions. This encompasses data, hardware, software, networks, and even physical devices controlled by computers.

#### Key Security Properties:
1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring only authorized parties have access to non-public information. This is often achieved through access control and data encryption.
2. **Integrity**: Keeping data, software, and hardware unaltered except by authorized parties. Techniques like access controls and cryptographic checksums support this goal.
3. **Authorization**: Limiting access to resources only to approved entities. This is enabled by access control mechanisms.
4. **Availability**: Maintaining continuous access for authorized use. This requires protection against intentional disruptions like denial of service attacks.

#### Additional Goals:
5. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of principals (users or system processes). This supports authorization and accountability.
6. **Accountability**: Identifying principals responsible for actions, usually through electronic logs or transaction evidence.

#### Important Terminology:
- **Trusted vs. Trustworthy**: 'Trusted' means something has our confidence, whereas 'Trustworthy' means it deserves our confidence.
- **Confidentiality vs. Privacy**: Confidentiality involves preventing unauthorized information disclosure, while Privacy is about protecting personally sensitive information.
- **Anonymity**: Related to privacy, it's the ability to keep one's actions unlinked to a public identity.

Overall, the chapter lays the foundation for understanding the multifaceted nature of computer security, highlighting the necessity of a comprehensive approach to protecting a variety of computer-related assets.
